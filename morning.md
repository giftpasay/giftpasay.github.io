## The Urgency of the Hour

Ptr. Sael opened with a penetrating question that echoes through the corridors of time: **"Are You Ready?"** This isn't merely a casual inquiry but a soul-searching examination of our spiritual preparedness for Christ's return.

Drawing from Jesus' own words in Matthew 24, Ptr. Sael emphasized that understanding the end times isn't about satisfying curiosity—it's about spiritual readiness.

## Jesus' Prophetic Warning - Matthew 24:1-6

Jesus began His discourse on the end times with a sobering warning:

> _"And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."_ — **Matthew 24:2**

When the disciples asked about the signs of His coming and the end of the world, Jesus immediately warned:

> _"Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet."_ — **Matthew 24:4-6**

**Key insights from Christ's warning:**

- **Deception will increase** - False christs and false prophets will multiply
- **Wars and conflicts** will be commonplace, but these are just the beginning
- **Don't be troubled** by world events, but be discerning
- **All prophecy must be fulfilled** according to God's timeline

## The Great Commission and the End - Matthew 24:14

Jesus connected the end times directly to the church's mission:

> _"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."_ — **Matthew 24:14**

Ptr. Sael emphasized that the return of Christ is directly linked to the completion of the Great Commission. The church's primary focus should remain on evangelism and discipleship, knowing that our faithful obedience accelerates His return.

**Critical understanding:** The end times aren't just about waiting—they're about working while we wait.

## The Character of the Last Days - 2 Timothy 3:1

Paul's prophetic warning to Timothy reveals the moral decline of the final era:

> _"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come."_ — **2 Timothy 3:1**

Ptr. Sael outlined the characteristics Paul described for the last days:

**Spiritual characteristics of the end times:**

- **Perilous times** - dangerous and difficult seasons
- **Self-centered society** - lovers of themselves more than God
- **Moral deterioration** - without natural affection, unthankful, unholy
- **Religious deception** - having a form of godliness but denying its power
- **Increased wickedness** - evil men growing worse and worse

**The sobering reality:** These aren't future prophecies—they're present realities we're witnessing today.

## The Wake-Up Call - Romans 13:11-14

Paul's urgent call to the Roman church speaks directly to our generation:

> _"And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light."_ — **Romans 13:11-12**

Ptr. Sael emphasized three critical points from this passage:

### 1. Know the Time

**"Knowing the time"** - Believers must be spiritually discerning about the season we're in. This isn't about date-setting but about spiritual awareness.

### 2. Wake Up from Spiritual Sleep

**"High time to awake out of sleep"** - Many believers have become spiritually drowsy, comfortable in routine religion while missing the urgency of the hour.

### 3. Our Salvation Draws Near

**"Our salvation nearer than when we believed"** - Every day brings us closer to Christ's return. What seemed distant to the early church is imminent for us.

## Practical Preparation for Christ's Return

Ptr. Sael outlined specific steps for end-times readiness:

### Cast Off Works of Darkness

> _"Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light."_ — **Romans 13:12**

**This requires:**

- **Honest self-examination** - identifying areas of compromise
- **Genuine repentance** - turning from sin to righteousness
- **Renewed commitment** - living as children of light

### Put On the Armor of Light

> _"Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof."_ — **Romans 13:13-14**

**Practical applications:**

- **Walk honestly** - live with integrity in all relationships
- **Avoid fleshly indulgences** - maintain moral purity
- **Put on Christ** - let His character be seen in our daily lives
- **Make no provision for flesh** - don't create opportunities for sin

## Signs We Cannot Ignore

Ptr. Sael highlighted contemporary signs that align with biblical prophecy:

**Global indicators:**

- Unprecedented global connectivity fulfilling the Great Commission
- Increase in natural disasters and unusual weather patterns
- Rise of false religions and spiritual deception
- Moral relativism replacing absolute truth
- Persecution of Christians worldwide
- Israel's restoration as a nation
- Technology enabling global surveillance and control

**Church indicators:**

- Apostasy within denominations
- Emphasis on entertainment over genuine worship
- Compromise with worldly values
- Loss of reverence for God's Word
- Declining prayer and fasting
- Lukewarm Christianity becoming the norm

## The Question That Demands an Answer

Ptr. Sael returned to his opening question with increased urgency: **"Are You Ready?"**

**This readiness involves:**

### Spiritual Readiness

- **Born again experience** - genuine salvation through Christ
- **Filled with the Holy Spirit** - empowerment for holy living
- **Walking in righteousness** - consistent Christian character
- **Regular communion with God** - prayer, Bible study, worship

### Practical Readiness

- **Witnessing actively** - participating in the Great Commission
- **Living purely** - maintaining moral and ethical standards
- **Serving faithfully** - using gifts and talents for God's kingdom
- **Watching expectantly** - maintaining hope in Christ's return

### Relational Readiness

- **Forgiveness extended** - harboring no bitterness or grudges
- **Love demonstrated** - showing Christ's love to others
- **Unity maintained** - promoting peace within the body of Christ
- **Accountability accepted** - living transparently with fellow believers

## The Urgency of Now

Ptr. Sael emphasized that readiness cannot be postponed:

**Why now is critical:**

- **Tomorrow is not guaranteed** - death can come unexpectedly
- **Christ's return is imminent** - He comes as a thief in the night
- **Today is the day of salvation** - procrastination is spiritual suicide
- **The harvest is ready** - souls are waiting to hear the gospel

## The Challenge to the Church

The sermon concluded with a direct challenge to every believer:

**Personal inventory questions:**

- If Christ returned today, would you be ready?
- Is your life producing fruit worthy of repentance?
- Are you actively participating in the Great Commission?
- Have you put off the works of darkness?
- Are you wearing the armor of light?

**Church-wide challenges:**

- Are we preaching the true gospel or a watered-down version?
- Is our focus on entertainment or genuine spiritual transformation?
- Are we preparing people for Christ's return or just church membership?
- Do we demonstrate the love and power of God in our community?

> _"Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come."_ — **Matthew 24:42**

Ptr. Sael's message was unmistakably clear: The signs are evident, the time is short, and the question remains personal and urgent. We cannot afford to be spiritually asleep when Christ returns. The end times aren't just a theological concept—they're our present reality demanding immediate spiritual response.

**The final word:** Readiness isn't about perfect knowledge of prophetic timelines—it's about perfect surrender to the lordship of Jesus Christ. The question isn't when He's coming, but are you ready when He comes?
