## Theme for 2026

**“THE CHURCH UNLEASHED FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT; BECAUSE OF SOULS”**

---

## Proposition

GIFT family, before this year (2025) ends, and we start traversing 2026; we must all be reminded that we are in a spiritual warfare. Brethren, **FAITH IS A FIGHT.** The reason for the Armors given (2 Cor. 10:4-5).

> “The Weapons of our warfare are not carnal; but mighty through God; to the pulling down of strongholds”

thus, it must be wielded; Use it to Fight a Good Fight of Faith.

With our (UPCPI) potential Theme for 2026, **“MAXIMUM IMPACT; BECAUSE OF SOULS”**, GIFT CHURCH must be UNLEASHED…

(Let me borrow Michael Buffer style)  
“Ladies and Gentlemen, Young people and Warriors of all ages… for everyone in attendance today… Ladies and Gentlemen, Are you ready?…”

## Fire @ Bridge

Whether we like it or not; whether we understand it or not; whether were ready or not; **WE ARE AT WAR!** Thus, an understanding of this Spritual Warfare is essential for those serious in defeating the giants of our age. We must not be satisfied with living in, the “status quo” Christian life. Spiritual warriors are sold out for the cause of Christ. Our prayer today is that we will be able to challenge all who understand; the Spiritual warfare, to step out into the Battle fields of our age…

Rumble means “a street fight between gangs or large groups.” We are currently fighting the forces of darkness…

“During the third century when St Felix of Nola was running from his enemies, he took refuge in a cave. Eventually a spider began to weave a web across the small opening, sealing it off and making it look like nobody had been inside for months. Consequently, his pursuers just passed by not seeing him who is inside. Stepping out into the sunshine, Felix declared,

> ‘Where God is, a spider’s web is a wall. And where God is not, a wall is a spider’s web.’”

## Bridge: Spiritual Attack

Tony Evans says:

> “You know, I’m awesome when I play basketball by myself, because there is no competition. Put someone in front of me waving his hand in my face, though, and it’ becomes a different ball game. The proof of how good you are is when you are opposed.”

Do you quit when the devil starts waving his hand in your face? God allows opposition so that you might prove that “the One who is in you in greater than he is in the world” (1 John 4:4).

When you are under attack spiritually, it usually signals that God is going to use you (to be a blessing or to bless others). The enemy doesn’t attack people who are not a threat; he doesn’t attack people for no reason. If you are being attacked it’s because you are a threat and you are taking ground from the devil. And so he attacks; the devil wants to rob us of our joy and make us miserable, and one weapon he uses is discouragement. He tries to discourage and deflate us.

> “Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices (schemes)”  
— 2 Corinthians 2:11 (KJV)

## I. PREPARE FOR WAR! LET’S GET READY TO RUMBLE!

> “Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:

> 11 Assemble yourselves, and come,..”
— Joel 3:9-11 (KJV)

### Spiritual Warfare (Ephesians 6:10-12)

> 12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”

— Jude 3 (AMP)

## III. FIGHT FOR THE BASIC FUNCTIONS OF THE CHURCH

● To grow in relationship to God – **Magnification / Worship**  
● To grow in relationship to each other – **Fellowship and Community Membership**  
● To reach out to serve others inside and outside of our group and church and Make a Difference in people’s lives in Jesus’ name. – **Ministry / Service**  
● To grow members of the group to leadership readiness and multiply new groups – **Maturity / Discipleship**  
● To intentionally share the love of Christ with our Friends, Relatives, Associates and Neighbors. – **Mission’s / Evangelism**

## IV. ITS TIME TO RISE FOR A RIOT!

When we read the headlines, it is not hard to see that our world is on a downward slide. Political tensions, natural disasters, and disease outbreaks are escalating. More and more professed believers seem to be falling away from the faith. It has caused many people to wonder whether these events are part of biblical prophecy. I can say with certainty that we are closer to the Rapture and the Tribulation than ever before. And, even as the world hurtles toward earth's / humanities Last Days, we can find hope in God's Word.

RIOT- Mr.webster defines it as “a violent public disorder; specifically : a tumultuous disturbance of the public peace by a crowd; assembled together and acting with a common intent.”

But the Church defines RIOT now, as **REVIVAL IN OUR TIMES!!!**

Its TIME FOR A R.I.O.T.! Let the Redeemed rise up; the Blood bought, Holy Spirit filled, Apostolic Pentecostal Church Rise for a Riot!

RISE UP FOR A RIOT! Inside and Outside the Church; your Homes and your Family, your communities.
