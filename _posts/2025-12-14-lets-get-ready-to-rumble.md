_Service: GIFT Worship_  
_Second Sunday Worship_  
_Date: December 14, 2025_  

_Theme for Today: “The Real Reason for the Season”_  

_Theme for 2026:_  
**“The Church Unleashed for Maximum Impact; Because of Souls”**

---

## Sermon for Today

**Text:**  
1 Timothy 6:12-16 / 2 Timothy 4:7-8 (KJV)

---

## Proposition

GIFT family, before this year 2025 ends and as we begin moving toward 2026, we must be reminded of one clear truth: we are in a spiritual warfare.

Brethren, faith is a fight.

The armor was given for a reason.  
> “For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds.”  
2 Corinthians 10:4-5 (KJV)

These weapons must be wielded. They are meant to be used to fight the good fight of faith.

With our UPCPI potential theme for 2026, “Maximum Impact; Because of Souls,” GIFT Church must be unleashed.

(Let me borrow a Michael Buffer style moment)

“Ladies and gentlemen, young people and warriors of all ages. For everyone in attendance today. Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready?”

## Fire @ Bridge

Whether we like it or not, whether we understand it or not, whether we are ready or not, we are at war.

An understanding of spiritual warfare is essential for anyone serious about defeating the giants of our age. We must not be satisfied with a status quo Christian life. Spiritual warriors are sold out for the cause of Christ.

Our prayer today is that those who understand spiritual warfare will step out into the battlefields of our generation.

Rumble is defined as a street fight between gangs or large groups. Spiritually speaking, we are fighting the forces of darkness.

**Illustration: St. Felix of Nola**

During the third century, when St. Felix of Nola was running from his enemies, he hid in a cave. A spider wove a web across the entrance, making it appear untouched. His pursuers passed by without noticing him.

Felix later declared,  
“Where God is, a spider’s web is a wall. And where God is not, a wall is a spider’s web.”

## Bridge

Tony Evans describes spiritual attack this way:

“You know, I’m awesome when I play basketball by myself, because there is no competition. Put someone in front of me waving his hand in my face, though, and it becomes a different ball game. The proof of how good you are is when you are opposed.”

God allows opposition so that we might prove that the One who is in us is greater than the one in the world (1 John 4:4).

If you are under spiritual attack, it is often because God plans to use you. The enemy does not attack those who pose no threat. Discouragement is one of his main weapons, meant to steal joy and weaken resolve.

> “Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.”  
2 Corinthians 2:11 (KJV)

### C. It’s Time to Rise for a Riot

The world shows clear signs of decline. Political tension, disasters, disease, and falling away are increasing. We are closer than ever to the Rapture and Tribulation.

RIOT is defined as a violent public disturbance.

But for the Church today, RIOT means:  
**Revival In Our Times**

It is time for a riot.  
Let the redeemed rise.  
Let the blood-bought, Spirit-filled, Apostolic Pentecostal Church rise.

Rise in the church.  
Rise in the home.  
Rise in the community.
