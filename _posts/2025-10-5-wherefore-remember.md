## The Most Exciting Hour

**We're in the most exciting hour that the world has ever lived in.** It's not about what's going on out in the world, but what is going on inside - **what's going on in the Kingdom of God, the church of the living God!**

**Wherefore, let us remember...**

> *"Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."* — **2 Timothy 1:6-7**

## We Are God's Kids - Part of the Family

**A powerful testimony illustrates who we really are:**

As related by Rev. Lee Stoneking, a UPCI Minister, a Christian preacher became so powerful in his preaching that he was apprehended by Al-Qaeda. **They beat him until they thought he was dead, threw him in a room, locked the door, and left him.**

**But he was not dead.** The moment he regained consciousness, with bloody torn clothes, he stood up and said, "Jesus, I wish I were at home with my wife and family." **In an instant, when he opened his eyes, he was in their living room. No torn clothes. Not bloody.**

**That is who we are! It's in the Bible.** In Acts 8, Philip was transported in an instant!

**It's in the Book! We are God's kids; we're a part of the family of God!**

## Divine Enablement Through Spiritual Gifts

**There are divine enablements which make each follower of Christ valuable to the body of Christ and to the world.** Once a person becomes a Christian and is indwelt by the Holy Spirit, **the Spirit deposits one or more spiritual gifts.**

**Just as the various parts of the human body work together in unity, so spiritual gifts are given to the body of Christ to work together in unity.** The purpose of spiritual gifts is to:
- **Edify (build up) believers**
- **Mature Christians** for more effective ministry
- **Shape you** for your unique ministry calling

**It is one of the elements that make up your S.H.A.P.E. for Ministry.**

## I. Stir Up the Gift

> *"Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands."* — **2 Timothy 1:6**

### Understanding "Stir Up"

**The Greek word for "stir up" is anazopureo.** According to Thayer's Definitions, it means **"to kindle up, inflame one's mind, strength, zeal."**

**This is the only place this word is used in the New Testament** and is thus referred to in textual studies as a hapax legomenon (a word occurring only once in a document).

### The Metaphor of Fire

**When a fire began to die out, the coals could be stirred, and kindling could be added to rejuvenate the fire.** Sometimes the meaning of a hapax legomenon can be challenging to understand because there are no other usages to compare it to. But in 2 Timothy 1:6, the meaning is fairly easy to understand.

**Vine's Expository Dictionary explains** that anazopureo "is used metaphorically... where 'the gift of God' is regarded as a fire capable of dying out through neglect. The verb was in common use in the vernacular of the time."

**When this was written, fires were the primary source of heat.** When a fire began to die out:
- **The coals could be stirred** to expose hot embers
- **Kindling could be added** - small pieces of wood or flammable material
- **The fire could be rejuvenated** back to full strength

**Everyone in that time knew the meaning of this word.**

### Don't Quench the Spirit

**Paul wrote of the opposite concept in another letter:**

> *"Do not quench the Spirit."* — **1 Thessalonians 5:19**

**There are important lessons in this simple reference to stirring up the Holy Spirit within us** as a person might rekindle a fire. **There are strategies we can use to allow it to work more effectively in our lives.**

### Application: Stir It Up!

**Now that we've considered the background and meaning of Paul's message to Timothy, what can we conclude 2 Timothy 1:6 means for us today?**

**Like Timothy, we too should strive to "stir up the gift of God which is in us."** In other words, **stir up the Holy Spirit in your life!**

**This means:**
- **Don't let your spiritual gifts lie dormant**
- **Don't allow neglect to diminish the fire**
- **Actively fan the flames** of what God has placed within you
- **Add fuel** through prayer, worship, and the Word
- **Keep the fire burning bright** through consistent dedication

## II. God Has Given Us Power, Love, and a Sound Mind

> *"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."* — **2 Timothy 1:7**

**This verse reminds us of three essential gifts God has placed within every believer:**

### Power (Dunamis)
- **Supernatural ability** to accomplish God's purposes
- **Strength beyond our own** capabilities
- **Divine enablement** for ministry and witness
- **The same power** that raised Christ from the dead

### Love (Agape)
- **Divine, sacrificial love** that comes from God
- **Love that covers** a multitude of sins
- **Love that compels us** to share the gospel
- **Love that builds up** the body of Christ

### A Sound Mind (Sophronismos)
- **Self-discipline and self-control**
- **Mental clarity and wisdom**
- **Balanced thinking and good judgment**
- **Freedom from confusion** and chaos

**God has NOT given us a spirit of fear.** Fear is not from God. When we experience fear, we must remember what God HAS given us: **power, love, and a sound mind.**

## III. Remember to Testify

> *"Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord..."* — **2 Timothy 1:8**

**Paul challenges Timothy - and us - to never be ashamed of our testimony of Jesus Christ.**

### Paul's Declaration

> *"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."* — **Romans 1:16**

**The gospel is not something to hide or be embarrassed about.** It is:
- **The power of God** for salvation
- **Available to everyone** who believes
- **Life-transforming truth** that changes destinies
- **Our greatest message** to share with the world

**Your testimony matters:**
- **What God has done** in your life is unique
- **How He saved you** is your story to tell
- **The transformation He brought** encourages others
- **Your witness** may be the key to someone's salvation

**Don't be ashamed - testify boldly of what the Lord has done!**

## IV. We Are Saved and Called with a Holy Calling

> *"Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling..."* — **2 Timothy 1:9**

**God has not only saved us, but He has also called us with a holy calling.** This is a high and sacred calling that sets us apart for His purposes.

### God Chooses the Unlikely

> *"For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: That no flesh should glory in his presence."* — **1 Corinthians 1:26-29**

**God's calling often defies human logic:**
- **Not many wise** according to worldly standards
- **Not many mighty** in human power
- **Not many noble** by birth or status

**Instead, God chooses:**
- **The foolish things** to confound the wise
- **The weak things** to confound the mighty
- **The base and despised things** to bring to nothing the things that are
- **Things that are not** to nullify things that are

**Why does God work this way?** So that **no flesh should glory in His presence.** All glory belongs to God alone.

**Your calling is holy, regardless of:**
- Your background or education
- Your social status or reputation
- Your perceived weaknesses or limitations
- What others think of you

**If God has called you, He has equipped you for the calling.**

## V. God's Purpose and Grace

> *"...according to his own purpose and grace..."* — **2 Timothy 1:9**

**Our salvation and calling are not random - they are according to God's purpose and grace.**

### From Death to Life

> *"And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved)."* — **Ephesians 2:1-5**

**Remember where you came from:**
- **Dead in trespasses and sins** - spiritually lifeless
- **Walking according to this world** - following wrong paths
- **Under the influence** of the prince of the power of the air
- **Living in the lusts of the flesh** - controlled by sinful desires
- **Children of wrath by nature** - destined for judgment

**But God!** These two words change everything:
- **Rich in mercy** - abundant compassion
- **Great love** - incomprehensible affection
- **Quickened us** - made us alive
- **Together with Christ** - united with Him
- **By grace** - unmerited favor

**This is God's purpose:** To take what was dead and make it alive. To transform sinners into saints. To turn children of wrath into children of God.

**This is God's grace:** Undeserved, unearned, freely given salvation and calling.

## Practical Application: What to Remember

**As members of the body of Christ, we must remember:**

### 1. Remember Your Identity
- **You are God's child** - part of His family
- **You have supernatural access** - divine transportation is biblical
- **You are valuable** to the body of Christ and the world

### 2. Remember Your Gifts
- **The Holy Spirit has deposited gifts** within you
- **These gifts are not for personal glory** but for building up the body
- **Don't let them lie dormant** - stir them up!

### 3. Remember Your Equipment
- **Power** - to overcome and accomplish
- **Love** - to minister and serve
- **Sound mind** - to think clearly and make wise decisions

### 4. Remember Your Testimony
- **Never be ashamed** of what God has done
- **Your story is unique** and powerful
- **Someone needs to hear** what God did for you

### 5. Remember Your Calling
- **You are saved** - delivered from death to life
- **You are called** - with a holy, set-apart purpose
- **God chose you** - not because you're qualified, but to glorify Him

### 6. Remember God's Purpose
- **He saved you by grace** - not by your works
- **He has a plan for your life** - unique and specific
- **He made you alive** - when you were dead in sin

## Conclusion: Stir It Up!

**Wherefore, remember...** Remember who you are, whose you are, and what God has placed within you.

**The fire may have grown dim** through neglect, discouragement, or the distractions of life. **But it's not too late to stir it up again!**

**Like the coals of a dying fire can be stirred and kindling added to rejuvenate the flame, so can the gifts of God within you be stirred up and reignited.**

**We live in the most exciting hour the world has ever known.** Not because of what's happening in the world, but because of what God is doing in His church.
