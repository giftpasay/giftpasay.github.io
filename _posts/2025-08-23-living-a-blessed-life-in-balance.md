## Life is All About Balance

**Life is like walking on a tightrope** - we must master the art of maintaining balance while navigating the high-tensioned wire called life. **The key is balance.** As Albert Einstein wisely said, *"Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep on moving forward."*

**Balance is essential in every area of our existence.** When things are out of balance, there is a great tendency for things to get worse and not work properly.

> *"Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth."* — **3 John 2**

## The Quest for Success and Its Dangers

**Every person desires to become successful, prosperous, and rich** - even Bible-believing, God-fearing Christians desire this for specific purposes. **Unfortunately, because of ignorance, misinformation, and faulty wisdom, people have made crazy decisions** that they still regret or are paying consequences for today.

> *"But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil..."* — **1 Timothy 6:9-10**

**Some have gone to extremes to get rich, falling into temptations and snares.** We sometimes go to extremes when we want something badly, but **when things are out of balance, disaster follows.**

## The Danger of Extremes

**Balance is crucial because extremes lead to problems:**

### Physical Extremes
- **Too much eating** makes you fat; **too much dieting** makes you skinny
- **Too much stress** makes you weak; **too much rest** makes you lazy
- **Too much spending** makes you a shopaholic; **too much saving** makes you a hoarder

### Spiritual Extremes
- **Too much emphasis on prosperity** doesn't necessarily mean God's favor
- **Too much emphasis on poverty** as closeness to God is equally erroneous
- **Too much focus on spiritual matters** while refusing to discuss practical needs is unhealthy

**Both extremes are not good ways to understand how God's Kingdom operates.** We must unfold God's abounding blessings by living a blessed life in balance.

## God's Concern for Our Financial Well-being

**The theme of Christianity is not about prosperity or money alone, but God knows that while we're on Earth, our main concerns and worries usually revolve around financial provision.** This is why Jesus talked extensively about money matters:

### Jesus and Money
- **16 out of 38 parables** Jesus taught deal with possessions and money
- **The Bible has 500 verses** on prayer and faith
- **But over 2,350 verses** on money and possessions

**These statistics reveal that God wants us to know that our concerns are also His concerns.** He talked more about money matters because money matters to Him.

> *"And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son."* — **John 14:13**

## Multi-Dimensional Prosperity

**The prosperity of God is multi-dimensional.** It is God's will for us to prosper:
- **Financially** - having our material needs met
- **Physically** - enjoying good health
- **Spiritually** - having our souls prosper

**This is the three-part blessing of being obedient to His will and commands.** God's success plan for humanity encompasses the prospering of spirit, soul, and body with both spiritual and physical blessings.

### God's Thoughts Toward Us

> *"For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end."* — **Jeremiah 29:11**

**It is God's will for us to live a blessed life, not only in heaven but also here on Earth.** His thoughts toward us are thoughts of peace, prosperity, and hope.

## God's Supernatural Ability

> *"Now to Him who is able to [carry out His purpose and] do superabundantly more than all that we dare ask or think [infinitely beyond our greatest prayers, hopes, or dreams], according to His power that is at work within us."* — **Ephesians 3:20 AMP**

**God is able to do exceedingly, abundantly above all we can ask or think.** His power is unlimited, and His desire is to bless His people beyond measure.

## Seven Supernatural Blessings

**God wants to release seven supernatural blessings to those who honor Him:**

1. **Double Portion** (Joel 2:23)
2. **Financial Abundance** (Joel 2:24)
3. **Restoration** (Joel 2:25)
4. **Miracles** (Joel 2:26)
5. **God's Divine Presence** (Joel 2:27)
6. **Blessings Upon Your Family** (Joel 2:28)
7. **Deliverance** (Joel 2:32)

**These blessings are available to believers who walk in obedience and honor God with their lives.**

## The Church: Blessed Beyond Measure

> *"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world..."* — **Ephesians 1:3-4**

**The Church is blessed beyond measure with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places.** We have been chosen before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before Him in love.

## God's Challenge: Tithing and Offerings

### The Divine Challenge

> *"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it."* — **Malachi 3:10**

> *"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom."* — **Luke 6:38**

### The Purpose of Tithing

**Tithing and offerings are God's management program for His church.** He doesn't need our financial or material things - everything already belongs to Him. **He asks for 10% of everything (time, talents, treasures) as a sign of acknowledgment of this fact.**

**Key principles about tithing:**
- **Money is not our problem; management of it is**
- **Tithing is not about money; it's about management**
- **It's about our ability to set aside, our will, our control, our discipline**
- **God consistently says: put aside 10% of everything for My purpose**

## The Path to Prosperity

> *"This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success."* — **Joshua 1:8-9**

**The path to true prosperity involves:**
- **Meditating on God's Word** day and night
- **Observing and doing** what is written
- **Being strong and courageous**, not afraid or dismayed
- **Trusting that God is with you** wherever you go

> *"So keep the words of this covenant and obey them, so that you may prosper and be successful in everything that you do."* — **Deuteronomy 29:9 AMP**

## Living in Balance

**To live a blessed life in balance, we must:**

### Avoid Financial Extremes
- **Don't worship money** or make it your god
- **Don't despise money** or refuse to manage it wisely
- **Practice good stewardship** while trusting God's provision

### Maintain Spiritual Balance
- **Don't become so heavenly minded** you're no earthly good
- **Don't become so earthly minded** you forget eternal things
- **Keep both spiritual and practical matters** in proper perspective

### Practice Wise Management
- **Honor God with your tithe** and offerings
- **Make wise financial decisions** guided by biblical principles
- **Trust God's provision** while exercising personal responsibility

## Declaration of Balanced Blessing

**Make this declaration:** *"I choose to live a blessed life in balance. I will not go to extremes in my pursuit of success or in my spiritual life. I trust God's multi-dimensional prosperity for my spirit, soul, and body. I will honor Him with my tithe and offerings, knowing that He is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all I can ask or think."*

## Conclusion: The Blessed Life in Balance

**God's desire is for you to prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.** This is not about choosing between spiritual blessing and material provision - **it's about experiencing God's complete blessing in every area of your life.**

**Balance is the key.** When we maintain proper balance between:
- **Spiritual growth and practical living**
- **Trusting God and taking responsibility**
- **Receiving blessing and being a blessing**
- **Faith and wisdom in financial matters**

**We position ourselves to experience the fullness of God's abounding blessings.** Remember, God's thoughts toward you are thoughts of peace and prosperity. **His challenge stands: prove Him in your giving, and He will open the windows of heaven and pour out blessings you cannot contain.**

**Live blessed. Live balanced. Live in the fullness of God's abundant provision.**
