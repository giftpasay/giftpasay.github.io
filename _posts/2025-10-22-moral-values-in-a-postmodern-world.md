## GIFT SCRIPTURE STUDIES
**October 22, 2025 / 6:30-8:30 PM**

### FOREWORD
The main theme of this book by author David Bernard (UPCI GS) is how Apostolic Pentecostals should live and how the Apostolic Pentecostal church should minister in a diverse, postmodern world. (Edited for GIFT Church setting)

## SECOND SECTION: "THE APOSTOLIC CHURCH IN A POSTMODERN WORLD"
*(Positions the Apostolic movement in contrast to other historical and contemporary Christian movements. Identifies the essential elements of an Apostolic worldview.)*

### TOPIC: MORAL VALUES IN A POSTMODERN WORLD

**Scripture Ref: 2 Timothy 3:1-7 / 2 Timothy 4:3-4 (AMP)**

> "But understand this, that in the last days dangerous times [of great stress and trouble] will come [difficult days that will be hard to bear]. 2 For people will be lovers of self [narcissistic, self-focused], lovers of money [impelled by greed], boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy and profane, 3 [and they will be] unloving [devoid of natural human affection, calloused and inhumane], irreconcilable, malicious gossips, devoid of self-control [intemperate, immoral], brutal, haters of good, 4 traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of [sensual] pleasure rather than lovers of God, 5 holding to a form of [outward] godliness (religion), although they have denied its power [for their conduct nullifies their claim of faith]. Avoid such people and keep far away from them. 6 For among them are those who worm their way into homes and captivate morally weak and spiritually-dwarfed women weighed down by [the burden of their] sins, easily swayed by various impulses, 7 always learning and listening to anybody who will teach them, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."

> "For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine and accurate instruction [that challenges them with God's truth]; but wanting to have their ears tickled [with something pleasing], they will accumulate for themselves [many] teachers [one after another, chosen] to satisfy their own desires and to support the errors they hold, 4 and will turn their ears away from the truth and will wander off into myths and man-made fictions [and will accept the unacceptable]."

## The Postmodern Worldview

In today's world most people believe that morality is relative (kanya-kanyang pag-unawa), not absolute (tiyak). The prevailing philosophy, called postmodernism, says there is no absolute truth. How should Christians respond? Historically, most people in the US and Canada, (in the world) professed some form of Christian affiliation, and cultural norms were shaped by Judeo-Christian values. Today, however, many people are not Christian, and most no longer uphold biblical morality.

To illustrate, in recent years the US elected its first Muslim (2006) and Hindu representatives (2012) as well as its first Buddhist (2012) and openly homosexual senators (2012). In 1950 most people believed premarital sex and homosexual behavior were wrong. Society generally disapproved of divorce, and it was available only when one party proved fault by the other, such as adultery, abandonment, or cruelty. Abortion was illegal. The law did not recognize "same-sex marriage" or "transgender rights."

Today, most people believe premarital sex and homosexual behavior are acceptable. The law allows divorce for any reason. Abortion is generally legal up to and during birth. In 2004 Massachusetts became the first US state to redefine marriage to include same-sex couples. In 2012 Barack Obama became the first sitting US president to support same-sex marriage. In 2015 the US Supreme Court made same-sex marriage legal throughout the US.

Recent laws have redefined basic human identity. Anyone can choose to live as either male or female, and society must accommodate this choice. For example, in 2012 Evergreen College in Olympia, Washington, allowed a forty-five-year-old male who identifies as a woman but who is physically a male to have access to the women's locker room, where he displayed himself fully nude in a place used by elementary and high school girls. The college said it had no choice under state law regarding transgender rights.

## The Early Church's Similar Challenge

When the first-century church moved beyond Judaism into the Gentile world, it faced a similar cultural environment. Pagan religions promoted "sacred" prostitution on temple precincts, and Emperor Nero married a boy named Sporus. Nevertheless, the Church grew rapidly, not by legal or social influence but by the Holy Spirit. The church can do the same today, promoting moral values in an immoral world.

## Living as Witnesses

First and foremost, we can do so as living witnesses. The best way to proclaim biblical values is to live good moral lives, repent of any failures, build strong marriages and families, and be productive citizens in society. The apostle Peter instructed, "Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul. Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us" (I Peter 2:11-12, NIV).

## Proclaiming Hope

We should proclaim a positive message with hope. Jesus did not come to condemn the world but to provide salvation and a new way of life. (See John 3:16-21; 8:10-11.) Peter instructed, "Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander" (I Peter 3:15-16, NIV).

## Speaking Truth in Love

We should preach and teach truth but always in love (Ephesians 4:15), with wisdom and understanding (Colossians 1:9-10). People aren't our enemy; therefore, we shouldn't attack people. We oppose sin because it is destructive. We promote righteousness because it is our Creator's plan for us and is best for everyone. God forgives, delivers, transforms, and provides abundant life. Whatever He commands, He enables; and His grace always gives before it requires.

## Engaging in Society While Trusting God

We should work for social, legal, and political solutions when we can, but as the church we should not align ourselves with political candidates or parties. We need to preserve the church's ability to minister to people of all political persuasions and to speak with moral clarity regardless of political alliances. As individuals we can participate in the political process as long as we realize that our ultimate hope is in the kingdom of God. Sometimes we won't see the results we desire; nevertheless, God is still in control (Proverbs 21:1). He brings down one leader and exalts another, and He brings judgment on leaders who do evil (Psalm 75:6-10). This does not mean every result is His perfect will. God sometimes allows people to have what they ask for or deserve. When Israel insisted on a king despite God's plan, God finally told the prophet Samuel to give them a king (I Samuel 8:22).

We must respect governmental authority and pray for political leaders (I Timothy 2:1-4; I Peter 2:13-17). Specifically, we should pray for government to fulfill its proper role of administering justice, providing security and peace, and giving opportunity for the gospel. These biblical instructions were given under the Roman Empire, which exercised dictatorial control over Palestine. We are to follow them even if we don't agree with our leaders or form of government.

## Our Hope and Mission

Our hope is in God, and we proclaim Jesus Christ as the answer for the world today. As social systems crumble and as immorality seemingly triumphs, some people will seek for spiritual answers, and the church will be a beacon of hope. Contrary to the prevailing culture, which accepts all beliefs and lifestyles as valid, we still proclaim truth. In the face of sin and its consequences, we preach love, hope, forgiveness, deliverance, and transformation by the power of the Holy Spirit.

## Statement on Marriage

### Continue to uphold God's Word

In God's plan marriage is the union of one man and one woman who make a lifelong commitment. This definition of marriage is foundational in God's creative purpose and moral code for the human race (Genesis 1:27; 2:24). Jesus Himself taught this truth (Matthew 19:3-9). Moreover, God designed the sexual relationship only for such a marriage. Thus, the Bible teaches that adultery, fornication, and homosexual conduct are wrong. (See Mark 7:21-23; Romans 1:21-27; I Corinthians 6:9-11.)

### Proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ

Jesus Christ did not come into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through Him (John 3:17). God came in Christ to reconcile the world to Himself. Likewise, our mission is not condemnation but reconciliation; we implore everyone to be reconciled to God (II Corinthians 5:18-20). We proclaim the good news of salvation through Jesus (I Corinthians 15:1-4), which enables us to be born again (John 3:5; Acts 2:38-39). The new birth brings deliverance and transformation so that, regardless of our past, all of us can grow in grace, walk in holiness, and fulfill God's plan for our lives (I Corinthians 6:11).

### Continue to affirm the worth and dignity of every human being

God has created all of us in His image, and Jesus Christ died for all. We should treat people with respect and kindness even when we disagree with their behavior or lifestyle. We should recognize everyone's civil rights while realizing that, as the US Declaration of Independence states, true human rights come from our Creator and not from government. Our refusal to redefine marriage has nothing to do with bigotry or hatred. We recognize that God has given people freedom of choice and that some activities are legal but not permissible for Christians. In these cases, we disagree with those who do not share our faith. As Paul instructed, we should speak the truth in love, and we should use wisdom and gracious speech in discussing matters such as these with unbelievers (Ephesians 4:15; Colossians 4:5-6).

### Defend the freedoms of speech, press, association, and religion

These freedoms will likely come under attack by those who wish to silence all opposition, and thus we need to participate in the political and legal process to uphold them. It is not "hate speech" for Christians to preach and teach about sin and righteousness. We must vigorously oppose all attempts to compel Christian institutions such as churches, schools, adoption agencies, and counseling services to endorse same-sex marriage. Likewise, we must oppose any attempt to take away their tax-exempt status because of their religious beliefs in this matter. Christian businesses should serve all people without discrimination, but they shouldn't be forced to participate in speech or other activities that contradict their values.

## Statement on Transgenderism

As Christians we should treat everyone with love, respect, and compassion. We should also bear witness that God has created humans as male and female (Genesis 1:27). While some erroneously suggest that gender is merely a social or psychological construct, it originates in God's creative purpose and is rooted in genetic and biological reality. In rare cases of atypical anatomy, qualified medical personnel can be consulted.

Aside from such rare cases, families and society should strongly affirm each individual's biological, anatomical gender. For those who experience gender dysphoria (psychological distress with their sex or gender as determined by their physical anatomy), we recommend spiritual and professional counseling by qualified persons who are committed to biblical values. When children and youth experience confusion related to their social gender identity, we should provide them with biblically based encouragement, training, and modeling. We should not block or subvert puberty through artificial means, as that would sacrifice children to social and political agendas in contradiction to both biology and theology.

Our view is that public restrooms, changing rooms, and showers should be segregated by sex as determined by anatomy rather than as constructed by personal feelings and preferences. Private rooms can be designated for those who express difficulty with this standard arrangement. Individual or family restrooms are already available in many public facilities. The privacy, modesty, moral values, peace of mind, security, and safety of the overwhelming majority of people who affirm traditional biological gender should not be compromised for the sake of political expediency. Safety is an issue not because of people who identify as transgender, but because of predators who could take advantage of the opportunity to harass or molest people of the opposite sex.

## A Call to Prayer

Pray for our nation and our world. God is still in control, and our hope is in Him. Where sin abounds, grace does much more abound (Romans 5:20). When Paul encountered opposition, he asked the church to pray for an open door for him to speak the word clearly (Colossians 4:3-4). When the apostolic church experienced persecution, they prayed for boldness to speak the word and for signs and wonders in the name of Jesus (Acts 4:29-30). In these last days, God has promised to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh (Acts 2:17-18). Let's pray for apostolic, end-time revival!
