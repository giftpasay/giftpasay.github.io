## The Blessing of Reading and Hearing

Ptr. Sael opened this foundational message by emphasizing the unique blessing promised to those who engage with God's final revelation:

> _"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand."_ — **Revelation 1:3**

Ptr. Sael stressed a powerful truth: **You are blessed today simply for being here.** Whether you're reading this prophecy or hearing it proclaimed, God's blessing rests upon you. But there's a crucial condition - we must **keep** the things written in this book.

### Why the Time is at Hand

> _"I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches... Surely I come quickly."_ — **Revelation 22:16, 20**

Ptr. Sael reminded the congregation that **the water of life is free today**. Anyone can come, anyone who thirsts can drink freely from God's provision. But he also warned about the seriousness of this revelation - adding to or taking away from these words brings severe consequences.

## Living in the Last Days

Ptr. Sael addressed the reality of our current times with pastoral concern:

**As believers in this generation, we shouldn't be surprised or overly troubled** by current events. These things will surely come to pass as the Lord has declared. We're witnessing what the Bible calls the **"fullness of times"** - God's appointed plans unfolding in our generation.

### The Need for Spiritual Preparedness

> _"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge."_ — **Hosea 4:6**

Ptr. Sael emphasized a sobering truth: **God's people can be destroyed through ignorance.** In our current times, believers must become **fully aware** of who we really are and what's happening around us. The enemy blinds the minds of unbelievers, but **believers must not be blinded.**

## Apokalypsis Iesou Christou - The Heart of the Message

Ptr. Sael chose to preach in Greek to emphasize the profound nature of this revelation: **"Apokalypsis Iesou Christou"** - The Revelation of Jesus Christ.

### Understanding True Revelation

**Revelation means:** An act of revealing or communicating divine truth. It's not just any truth, but **divine truth** - the kind that sets people free according to John 8:32.

**This is not about catastrophe or disaster** as many wrongly assume when they hear "apocalypse." This is about **the unveiling of divine truth** - showing us things as they really are, especially concerning our Lord Jesus Christ.

### The Mystery of God Revealed

> _"Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh."_ — **1 Timothy 3:16**

When Jesus walked this earth for three and a half years, He came as a servant, as one who gave His life for our salvation. **But when He returns, He's not coming back as a servant** - He's coming back as **King of kings and Lord of lords**. He will be the judge.

## Christ's Victory Already Accomplished

Ptr. Sael powerfully declared the finished work of Christ:

> _"It is finished."_ — **John 19:30**

When Jesus uttered these words on the cross, **your sins were paid in full**. The sin of the whole world was completely paid for. Now all humanity needs to do is:

- **Recognize Jesus Christ**
- **Accept what He did on the cross of Calvary**
- **Give their lives to the Lord**
- **Serve Him faithfully**

### Current Events in Biblical Perspective

Ptr. Sael addressed current Middle Eastern conflicts, noting that **what's happening between Iran and Israel is not accidental.** These are signs of the times, fulfillments of biblical prophecy that we're witnessing in our generation.

## The Alpha and Omega Speaks

> _"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty."_ — **Revelation 1:8**

**Jesus Christ is the Almighty** - there can only be one Almighty, and He is it. When John saw Him in His glorified state, he fell as dead at His feet because of the overwhelming power and glory of God.

### Christ Holds the Keys

> _"I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death."_ — **Revelation 1:18**

**The keys of death and hell are in Christ's hands.** This means He has complete authority over life, death, and eternal destiny. What comfort this brings to believers!

## How This Revelation Should Influence Us

Ptr. Sael outlined several ways studying Revelation should impact our lives:

### 1. Personal Salvation Awareness

We must **seriously consider our own salvation** - not just others', but our own relationship with God. How has the Lord protected you? How has He saved you, healed you, performed miracles in your life?

### 2. Evangelistic Urgency

Understanding God's power should give us a **moral obligation** to share the Word of God with those who don't know Him. We must bring people to Christ and share the Gospel with them.

### 3. Holy Living in View of His Return

**Christ's return is imminent** - it could happen at any moment. This should cause us to **desire to live pure, holy lives** as we anticipate His coming.

Ptr. Sael challenged: _"Lord, when You return, may You find me serving You. May You find me doing Your work, preaching, sharing Your Word, or better yet - may You find me fasting and crying out to You."_

### 4. Comfort in God's Control

**Don't worry - God is in control.** He sits on the throne, and there's only one throne in heaven. He commands everything that comes to pass according to His will.

### 5. Hope for Reunification

For those who've lost believing loved ones, **there will be a grand reunion** where we'll see them again, enjoying the presence of the Lord together.

## The Call to Diligent Service

> _"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."_ — **1 Corinthians 15:58**

**Your service to God is not meaningless.** Whatever you've done for the Lord, God knows about it. Even if others don't acknowledge it, our great God sees everything, and you will receive blessing from what you've done.

## The Ultimate Question: Are You Ready?

Ptr. Sael concluded with a penetrating question that every believer must answer:

**If the trumpet sounds right now, if the rapture happens this afternoon - would you be taken?**

God's will is for everyone to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. He wants you included. He wants all of us to be saved.

## A Personal Word from the Pastor

Ptr. Sael shared vulnerably about times when we might feel discouraged, thinking we could do more if circumstances were different. But he reminded us of a powerful truth: **"There is no problem so big that God cannot solve it, there is no mountain too tall He cannot move it."**

**Guard your Christianity.** Guard the blood that the Lord poured out for you. Guard your relationship with the Lord. Don't compromise the things that matter eternally.

> _"He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus."_ — **Revelation 22:20**

This is just the beginning of our journey through the Revelation of Jesus Christ. The Lord desires that our knowledge of Bible prophecy would influence us to devote ourselves to serving those around us as we await His return.

**Apokalypsis Iesou Christou** - the revelation of Jesus Christ is unfolding before our very eyes. The question remains: What are you waiting for?
