Baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is not a denominational preference—it is a **biblical command**. Oneness Pentecostals baptize in Jesus’ name because it aligns with the apostolic pattern and clearly declares the name of the One who saves. It is an essential part of the new birth experience and the covenantal act of identifying with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

## The Biblical Command

In Acts 2:38, Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost and speaking under divine inspiration, declared:

> “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins…”

This was not a suggestion. It was the fulfillment of Jesus’ instructions in Matthew 28:19, where He said:

> “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”

The key word is _name_—singular. What is that name? **Jesus**. The apostles understood that the titles Father, Son, and Holy Ghost describe roles, but **the saving name is Jesus** (Acts 4:12).

## Apostolic Practice

Every recorded baptism in the Book of Acts was performed **in the name of Jesus**:

- **Acts 2:38** – _“...baptized… in the name of Jesus Christ…”_
- **Acts 8:16** – _“...only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.”_
- **Acts 10:48** – _“...he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.”_
- **Acts 19:5** – _“...they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.”_

This was the **norm** for the early Church—not an exception.

## The Power of the Name

The name of Jesus carries authority, power, and salvation:

- **Acts 4:12** – _“Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven… whereby we must be saved.”_
- **Colossians 3:17** – _“Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus…”_

Baptism is more than symbolic. It’s the moment when sins are **remitted**—washed away—by the power of Jesus’ name (Acts 22:16).

## Obedience to the Gospel

Romans 6 teaches that we are baptized **into Christ’s death**, buried with Him through baptism. If baptism represents His burial, then using His name is **essential**. No one was buried in the title “Father” or “Son”—He was buried as **Jesus**.
