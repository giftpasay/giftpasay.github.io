The name of Jesus holds a central and powerful place in the Apostolic doctrine of salvation. Oneness Pentecostals believe that **salvation comes through faith in the name of Jesus**, and that His name is essential in baptism, prayer, and spiritual authority. This conviction is not merely traditional—it is firmly grounded in Scripture and the teachings of the early church.

## The Authority of the Name

Throughout the New Testament, the name of Jesus is repeatedly emphasized as the source of salvation and divine authority. In **Acts 4:12**, Peter boldly proclaims:

> “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”

This verse underscores that salvation is not found in titles or in any other religious figure, but **exclusively through the name of Jesus**. The name is not a mere label—it represents the very identity, power, and authority of God revealed in flesh.

## Baptism in the Name of Jesus

A distinctive teaching of the Oneness Pentecostal movement is **baptism in the name of Jesus Christ**, as modeled by the early church. Every recorded instance of baptism in the Book of Acts was done **in Jesus’ name**:

- Acts 2:38 – _“Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins...”_
- Acts 8:16 – _“…they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.”_
- Acts 10:48 – _“…he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.”_
- Acts 19:5 – _“…they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.”_

These scriptures make it clear that **the apostles understood and practiced Jesus Name baptism**, not simply repeating the formula of Matthew 28:19, but fulfilling it by invoking the revealed name—**Jesus**.

## Why the Name Matters

Names in the Bible are often linked to **identity, authority, and covenant**. In the Old Testament, God revealed Himself to His people through covenant names (e.g., Jehovah-Jireh, Jehovah-Rapha). In the New Testament, **Jesus is the supreme name** by which God has chosen to fully reveal Himself.

- **Philippians 2:9–11** teaches that God has given Jesus a name above every name, and every knee shall bow to Him.
- **John 14:14** assures believers that whatever they ask in Jesus' name, He will do.
- **Colossians 3:17** instructs us to do everything in word or deed in the name of the Lord Jesus.

In this light, **using the name of Jesus in baptism and prayer is not optional—it is commanded, biblical, and powerful**.

## Salvation Through Jesus Alone

Oneness Pentecostals affirm that Jesus is not one of many paths to God, but the only way. As Jesus Himself said in **John 14:6**:

> “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”

This exclusivity is not arrogance—it is truth. **Jesus is the revealed name of God**, and only by embracing His name in faith, repentance, baptism, and Spirit-filled living can one be saved.

## Conclusion

The name of Jesus is not just a point of doctrine—it is the heartbeat of salvation. It is in His name that sins are forgiven, prayers are answered, demons flee, and eternal life is given. To call upon the name of Jesus is to invoke the fullness of God's saving power. As the early church did, so we continue: preaching, baptizing, and living in **the matchless, mighty name of Jesus**.
