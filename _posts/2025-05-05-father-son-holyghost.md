Understanding the Godhead is central to knowing who God is and how He relates to humanity. Oneness Pentecostals affirm the absolute **oneness of God**—not as three separate persons, but as **one indivisible Spirit** who has revealed Himself as **Father, Son, and Holy Ghost**. These are not distinct persons in a Trinity, but **distinct roles or manifestations** of the one true God.

## One God

The Bible is crystal clear on the foundational truth of monotheism:

> “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.” — _Deuteronomy 6:4_

> “I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me…” — _Isaiah 45:5_

There are not three gods, nor is God split into three coequal persons. The God of the Bible is **one**, and this one God has manifested Himself in various ways, primarily as **Father, Son, and Holy Ghost**.

## The Father: God in Creation

The title **Father** refers to God in His transcendence—as Creator and Ruler of all. He is called Father because He is the source of all life, and especially of spiritual rebirth:

- **Malachi 2:10** – _“Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us?”_
- **John 4:24** – _“God is a Spirit…”_

As Father, God is eternal, invisible, and omnipresent. He spoke the world into existence and upholds all things by His power.

## The Son: God in Redemption

The **Son** is not an eternal second person, but **God manifested in flesh** (1 Timothy 3:16). The Sonship began at the incarnation, when God took on human form in the person of Jesus Christ.

- **Galatians 4:4** – _“But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman…”_
- **John 1:14** – _“And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us…”_

The Son is the visible image of the invisible God (Colossians 1:15). He is **God with us** (Matthew 1:23), fully divine and fully human. The Son did not exist as a separate person before Bethlehem, but existed in the mind and plan of God until the fullness of time.

## The Holy Ghost: God in the Church

The **Holy Ghost** is the same God working among and within His people. It is **God in action**, particularly in regeneration, empowerment, and sanctification.

- **Romans 8:11** – _“The Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you…”_
- **John 14:26** – _“The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost… he shall teach you all things…”_

The Holy Ghost is not a separate being from the Father or the Son. It is simply the **Spirit of God—Jesus Himself—living in the believer** (Romans 8:9-10).

## One God, Three Manifestations

The titles Father, Son, and Holy Ghost refer to **different ways God has revealed Himself** to accomplish His plan:

- As **Father**: Creator and sustainer of all things.
- As **Son**: God manifest in flesh to redeem us.
- As **Holy Ghost**: God working in and through believers today.

This is not a contradiction or confusion, but a beautiful revelation of how the one true God **relates to us in every stage of redemption**.

> “Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh…” — _1 Timothy 3:16_

## What About Matthew 28:19?

Some point to **Matthew 28:19** to support a Trinitarian view, where Jesus instructed to baptize
