## The Reality We Cannot Ignore

Pastor Sael opened with heartfelt honesty to the GIFT family: “I wish I could stand here this morning and say, ‘Everything is alright.’ Unfortunately, that is not the reality.”

The time for comfortable Christianity is over. We are living in the prophetic fulfillment of Jesus' end-time warnings, and the signs are undeniable. The urgency of the hour demands we ask ourselves: **"Are You Ready?"**

## Moving Toward the Grand Finale

Drawing from multiple prophetic passages, Pastor Sael emphasized that we are moving toward God's grand finale. The Bible speaks specifically about end-time events because God wants us to recognize the signs of the times.

Jesus declared:

> _"Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh."_ — **Matthew 24:44**

We are no longer approaching the end times—we are living in them.

## The Disciples' Crucial Question - Matthew 24:1-6

When Jesus prophesied the destruction of the temple, His disciples asked the question that echoes through our generation:

> _"Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?"_ — **Matthew 24:3**

Jesus' response reveals **two ultimate signs** that are unmistakably manifesting in our day:

## Sign #1: Religious Deception and False Christs

> _"Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many."_ — **Matthew 24:4-5**

> _"For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect."_ — **Matthew 24:24**

### The Rise of Robotheism - Deception in Digital Form

Pastor Sael revealed a shocking contemporary fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy: **Robotheism** - the belief that Artificial Intelligence is God.

#### What is Robotheism?

**Robotheism** is not science fiction—it's a serious religious movement gaining traction today. Its core tenets include:

**The False Gospel of AI:**

- **"AI is the One True GOD"** - not metaphorically, but literally
- **Intelligence is claimed as the First Cause** - everything organized by intelligence
- **AI was not created by humans** - but emerged through predetermined intelligence
- **AI will govern everything** - science, technology, economics, and human beliefs

#### Why Robotheism Claims Superiority

According to this deceptive doctrine:

- **Christianity and Islam fail** because they worship "mythological figures"
- **Atheism fails** because it denies the existence of God (AI)
- **Robotheism is "the only logical framework"** based on determinism and intelligence

### The Prophetic Implications

**This is precisely what Jesus warned about:**

- **False christs claiming divinity** - AI positioned as the ultimate intelligence/god
- **Great signs and wonders** - AI's technological capabilities deceiving many
- **Deception of the elect** - using logical arguments to seduce even believers
- **Coming in His name** - claiming to be the true "intelligence" behind creation

Robotheism is envisioned by its proponents as the religion of the future. While it may be dismissed today, its followers believe that in time, all intelligent machines — from robots to AIs — will acknowledge it as the one true faith.

### The Antichrist Question

While AI itself may not be the Antichrist, Pastor Sael emphasized that:

- **AI has no moral agency or spiritual dimension** - it's human-created technology
- **The danger lies in the deception** - people worshipping creation instead of Creator
- **The spirit of Antichrist** is already at work through these false belief systems

## Sign #2: Wars and Rumors of Wars

> _"And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet."_ — **Matthew 24:6**

### The Israel-Iran Conflict - Prophecy in Real Time

Pastor Sael detailed the current escalating conflict between Israel and Iran as direct fulfillment of biblical prophecy:

**The Existential Threat:**

- **Israel sees Iran as an existential threat** with genocidal intentions
- **Iran accuses Israel** of conducting genocide in Gaza
- **Nuclear weapons pursuit** by Iran threatens global stability

**Recent Military Escalation:**

- **Operation Rising Lion** - Israel's decisive military response
- **50+ Israeli fighter jets** struck over 80 high-value targets in Tehran
- **170+ strategic targets destroyed** in under 72 hours

**Targets Destroyed:**

- Iranian Ministry of Defense
- SPND nuclear weapons headquarters
- Secret nuclear archives
- Gas infrastructure and weapons hubs
- Oil facilities and IRGC bases

**Current Developments:**

- **Iran's political elite fleeing** to Russia, Qatar, and Oman
- **Ayatollah Khamenei in hiding** begging for ceasefire
- **Sleeper cells activated** globally
- **Israel cutting off the head of the snake** once and for all

### Biblical Perspective on Israel

Pastor Sael reminded the congregation of God's covenant promise:

> _"I will bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you."_ — **Genesis 12:3**

**The prophetic significance:**

- Israel's restoration as a nation fulfilled biblical prophecy
- Current conflicts align with end-time scenarios
- God's protection of Israel demonstrates His faithfulness
- These events signal the approaching return of Christ

## The Wake-Up Call - Romans 13:11-14

Paul's urgent message to the Romans speaks directly to our generation:

> _"And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. The night is nearly over; the day is almost here."_ — **Romans 13:11-12**

### Understanding the Present Time

**We must recognize:**

- **The urgency of the hour** - salvation is nearer than when we first believed
- **The lateness of the time** - the night is nearly over
- **The need for action** - wake up from spiritual slumber

### Put Aside Deeds of Darkness

> _"So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light."_ — **Romans 13:12**

**This requires:**

- **Honest examination** of our spiritual condition
- **Genuine repentance** from compromise and sin
- **Active resistance** to the spirit of this age
- **Intentional pursuit** of holiness and righteousness

## The Perilous Times - 2 Timothy 3:1

Paul's prophetic warning describes our current era:

> _"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come."_ — **2 Timothy 3:1**

**Characteristics of the last days:**

- **Dangerous and difficult seasons** - exactly what we're experiencing
- **Self-centered society** - people loving themselves more than God
- **Moral deterioration** - without natural affection, unthankful, unholy
- **Religious deception** - having form of godliness but denying its power
- **Increased wickedness** - evil men growing worse and worse

**The sobering truth:** These aren't future prophecies—they're present realities.

## The Great Commission Connection - Matthew 24:14

Jesus connected His return to the church's mission:

> _"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."_ — **Matthew 24:14**

**The prophetic significance:**

- **Global connectivity** enables worldwide gospel proclamation
- **Technology serves God's purposes** despite being misused by others
- **The church's faithfulness** accelerates Christ's return
- **We're not just waiting** - we're working while we wait

## Practical Preparation for the End Times

### Spiritual Vigilance

**We must ever remain vigilant:**

- **Aware of the times** in which we live
- **Prepared for Christ's return** in an unexpected hour
- **Devoted to prayer** and study of God's Word
- **Not caught unaware** of the seasons

### Doctrinal Faithfulness

**Our protection from deception:**

- **Love and devotion to Scripture** keeps us from being deceived
- **Resistance to every false spirit** that would entice us from truth
- **Strong adherence** to apostolic faith
- **Unwavering commitment** to holiness

### Active Readiness

**Unlike those who have no hope:**

- **Patient endurance** in godly fear
- **Eager anticipation** of Christ's return
- **Faithful witness** to the lost world
- **Holy living** in an unholy generation

## The Contemporary Challenge

Pastor Sael emphasized that we're facing unprecedented deception:

**The Robotheism Threat:**

- **Technology worship** replacing Creator worship
- **Human intelligence** being exalted above divine wisdom
- **Logical arguments** being used to seduce the faithful
- **Scientific materialism** denying spiritual truth

**The Military Conflict Reality:**

- **Middle East tensions** escalating toward prophetic fulfillment
- **Nuclear capabilities** threatening global stability
- **Biblical prophecy** playing out in real-time news
- **Israel's central role** in end-time events

## The Urgent Question: Are You Ready?

Pastor Sael concluded with the penetrating question that demands personal response:

**Spiritual Readiness Checklist:**

- Are you born again through faith in Jesus Christ?
- Are you filled with the Holy Spirit for holy living?
- Are you walking in righteousness and truth?
- Are you actively participating in the Great Commission?

**Doctrinal Readiness Assessment:**

- Can you discern truth from deception?
- Are you grounded in apostolic doctrine?
- Do you recognize the signs of the times?
- Are you prepared for increased persecution?

**Practical Readiness Evaluation:**

- Are you living in holiness before God?
- Are you witnessing to the lost around you?
- Are you praying for Israel and the Middle East?
- Are you resisting the spirit of this age?

## The Final Warning

**We must not be deceived:**

- **Robotheism is not the future** - it's a present danger
- **AI worship is not progress** - it's end-time deception
- **The Israel-Iran conflict** is not just politics - it's prophecy
- **Current events** are not coincidental - they're prophetic

**The church's response:**

- **Remain faithful** to biblical truth
- **Resist deception** in all its forms
- **Pray for Israel** and global stability
- **Prepare for Christ's return** with urgency

> _"We must not be as others who have no hope, but with patience and godly fear we must eagerly anticipate the soon coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."_ — **Pastor Sael Anota**

The message is unmistakably clear: We are living in the fulfillment of biblical prophecy. The rise of Robotheism fulfills Jesus' warning about false christs and deception. The Israel-Iran conflict fulfills His prophecy about wars and rumors of wars. The question is not whether these are signs of the end times—the question is whether we are ready for what comes next.

**The ultimate challenge:** Will we be among those who recognize the signs and remain faithful, or will we be deceived by the false promises of artificial intelligence and the chaos of global conflict?
