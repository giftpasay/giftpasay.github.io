## The Challenge of Our Times

**The times we live in demand our absolute best.** Scripture reveals that great changes are coming, and it will be a struggle to serve the Lord and minister His Word naturally. **As members of the church, the mystical body of Lord Jesus, we must fight and be triumphant. We must be all that we can be - all for His glory.**

> *"The only person who can stop you from becoming what God intends you to become is YOU!"* — **John C. Maxwell**

**Everything in the Bible is for us today because we serve a God who knows no impossibilities.** Keep believing, keep hoping, keep seeking, keep praying, keep on doing what's best. **Let's be all that we can be! All for God's glory.**

## Stretching to Our Maximum Potential

**Most people only use about 10% of their potential** - if they use as much as 25%, they are called geniuses. **If we can go from using 10% of our potential to using 20%, we could double our productivity and still have 80% of our potential untapped.**

> *"Success means a person is reaching the maximum potential available to him at any given moment."* — **Ted Engstrom**

**If success is tapping into available potential and making the best use of it, shouldn't Christians be more successful than non-Christians?**

### The Rubber Band Principle

**Rubber bands come in different sizes, colors, and shapes, but they all work on the same principle: they must be stretched to be effective.** Like rubber bands, our personalities, talents, and gifts are different, but **we're also not effective unless we are stretched.**

**If you're not stretching in your personal walk with God and in your abilities, you're not going to be as effective for God as you really need to be.**

> *"... greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world."* — **1 John 4:4**

> *"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."* — **Philippians 4:13**

**The power God gives to spirit-filled believers ought to make a world of difference between them and nonbelievers.** We have all these things through the power of God's Spirit that should enable us to live on a higher plane. **The question is: Where are we now?**

## Understanding Predestination and Choice

### The Church is Predestined

**This church was predestinated by God in His divine providential plan.** It was the will of God to have a people somewhere:
- **Worshipping Him** in Spirit and truth
- **Serving Him** joyfully
- **Fulfilling His perfect will** for their lives
- **Using their full potential** for the glory of His name
- **Being successful, victorious, holy & powerful** people in the world today

**The Church was predestinated for this cause - that even the gates of hell shall not prevail!**

### The Devil is Predestined

**The devil's destination is predestinated.** He is always on his way down:
- **Thrown out** of the Holy mount of God due to rebellion
- **Became the prince** and power of the air
- **In the Tribulation period**, he will be thrown downward to earth
- **In the Millennium**, he will be thrown into a bottomless pit
- **Finally**, he will be thrown into the lake of fire

**But this church is on her way up - we're going up, up, up in the air to meet Him in the clouds of Glory!**

### Individual Choice Matters

**The church is predestined. The devil's destination was predestined. But the individual has a will of his own.** Man can somehow mold his destiny day by day.

> *"You are what you are today because of the thoughts, attitudes, and choices you made yesterday. You will be what you will be tomorrow, because of the thoughts, attitudes, and choices you make today."*

## The SUCCESS Formula

**Being a SUCCESS requires:**

1. **S**elect your Goal
2. **U**nlock your imprisoned Potential
3. **C**ommit yourself to God's plan
4. **C**hart your Course
5. **E**xpect Problems
6. **S**tand Firm on your Commitment
7. **S**urrender Everything to Jesus Christ

## It Is Time to Be What We Are Called to Be

**We are moving toward a grand finale.** The Bible speaks specifically about end-time events because God wants us to recognize the signs of the times.

> *"Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh."* — **Matthew 24:44**

> *"And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed."* — **Romans 13:11**

### End-Time Warnings

> *"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables."* — **2 Timothy 4:3-4**

> *"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils."* — **1 Timothy 4:1**

## Eight Demands Because of the Times

**Because of the times we live in, our best is demanded. We are compelled to act accordingly:**

### 1. READINESS
> *"Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh."* — **Matthew 24:44**

> *"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear."* — **1 Peter 3:15**

### 2. STEWARDSHIP
> *"And he called his ten servants, and said unto them, Occupy till I come."* — **Luke 19:13**

**We must be faithful and wise stewards**, managing what God has entrusted to us until His return.

### 3. PATIENT WAITING
> *"So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."* — **1 Corinthians 1:7**

**We wait with earnest expectation** for the manifestation of the sons of God and the redemption of our bodies.

### 4. CHARITABLENESS
> *"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God."* — **1 Corinthians 4:5**

**Love must characterize our relationships** as we await His coming.

### 5. BLAMELESS LIVING
> *"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."* — **1 Thessalonians 5:23**

**We must shine as lights in the world**, blameless and harmless as sons of God.

### 6. PERFECT OBEDIENCE
> *"That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ."* — **1 Timothy 6:14**

**Complete obedience to God's commands** is required in these last days.

### 7. JOYFUL EXPECTATION
> *"Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ."* — **Titus 2:13**

**We live with joyful anticipation** of Christ's glorious appearing.

### 8. CONSTANT ABIDING
> *"And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming."* — **1 John 2:28**

**We must remain constantly connected** to Christ, like branches to the vine.

## Time to Change Our Language

> *"Every day you have another opportunity to affect your future with the words you speak to God."* — **Stormie Omartian**

**We are the offspring of a Speaking God!** Just as God spoke creation into existence, **our words have creative power** to shape our future and circumstances.

## Overcoming Doubt and Fear

**Our doubt is offensive to God because it dishonors Him.** It hinders and even makes Him unable to function effectively in our lives.

> *"And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief."* — **Matthew 13:58**

**Jesus was limited in His hometown** not by lack of power, but by the people's unbelief. **We must not limit God** through our doubts and fears.

## Fight the Good Fight of Faith

> *"Therefore I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies [dedicating all of yourselves, set apart] as a living sacrifice, holy and well-pleasing to God, which is your rational (logical, intelligent) act of worship. And do not be conformed to this world [any longer with its superficial values and customs], but be transformed and progressively changed [as you mature spiritually] by the renewing of your mind [focusing on godly values and ethical attitudes], so that you may prove [for yourselves] what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect [in His plan and purpose for you]."* — **Romans 12:1-2 AMP**

## Declaration of Excellence

**Make this declaration:** *"I choose to be all that God wants me to be. I will stretch to my God-given potential and not settle for mediocrity. I will be ready, faithful in stewardship, patient in waiting, charitable in love, blameless in living, perfect in obedience, joyful in expectation, and constant in abiding. I will fight the good fight of faith and be transformed by the renewing of my mind. All for His glory, honor, and majesty!"*

## Conclusion: Being All We Can Be

**The times we live in are urgent times.** End-time events are unfolding, and the church must rise to meet the challenge. **We cannot afford to operate at 10% of our potential** when God has called us to excellence.

**The question is not whether God is able** - He is more than able to do exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or think. **The question is whether we will stretch ourselves**, overcome our doubts and fears, and become all that God has called us to be.

**Let us be all God wants us to be - all for His glory, honor, and majesty!**
