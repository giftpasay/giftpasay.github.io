## Understanding God: Answers from the Bible

The Bible reveals God’s character, purpose, and love for humanity.  
Here are answers to some of life’s hardest questions — drawn directly from Scripture.

---

## About God’s Existence and Nature

### **1. If God is real, why doesn’t He show Himself to everyone clearly?**
> “The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His handiwork.” — *Psalm 19:1*  
> “For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made…” — *Romans 1:20*  

God has already revealed Himself through creation, His Word, and through Jesus Christ. Those who seek Him sincerely will find Him (*Jeremiah 29:13*).

---

### **2. How can we believe in God when there’s no ‘scientific proof’?**
> “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” — *Hebrews 11:1*  
> “By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God.” — *Hebrews 11:3*  

Faith is not blind; it’s trust based on God’s revealed truth and His works in creation, history, and changed lives.

---

### **3. Why does God allow evil and suffering?**
> “God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good.” — *Genesis 1:31*  
> “Through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin.” — *Romans 5:12*  

Evil came because humanity chose to disobey God. God allows free will, but He will one day remove all evil (*Revelation 21:4*).

---

### **4. If God is good, why does He send people to hell?**
> “The Lord is not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.” — *2 Peter 3:9*  
> “He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe… shall not see life.” — *John 3:36*  

God does not desire anyone to be lost. Hell is the result of rejecting His offer of salvation.

---

### **5. Is the God of the Old Testament different from Jesus in the New Testament?**
> “I the Lord do not change.” — *Malachi 3:6*  
> “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.” — *Hebrews 13:8*  

The same God who judged sin also showed mercy. Jesus revealed God’s love, fulfilling what was written in the Old Testament.

---

### **6. Why does God require worship — is He proud or insecure?**
> “You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.” — *Matthew 4:10*  
> “The Father seeks those who will worship Him in spirit and truth.” — *John 4:23*  

God doesn’t need worship — we do. Worship aligns our hearts with truth and reminds us that life centers on Him, not ourselves.

---

## About Suffering and Justice

### **7. Why do innocent people, especially children, suffer?**
> “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” — *Genesis 18:25*  
> “He will wipe away every tear from their eyes.” — *Revelation 21:4*  

We don’t see the full picture now, but God promises justice and comfort. He cares deeply and will restore all things in His time.

---

### **8. Why doesn’t God stop wars, disasters, and pain?**
> “In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” — *John 16:33*  
> “The creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption.” — *Romans 8:21*  

Evil and suffering are temporary. God is patient, giving humanity time to repent before making all things new.

---

### **9. Why do bad people prosper while good people suffer?**
> “Do not fret because of evildoers… for they shall soon be cut down like the grass.” — *Psalm 37:1-2*  
> “Our light affliction… is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.” — *2 Corinthians 4:17*  

Earthly success is temporary, but God rewards righteousness eternally.

---

## About Jesus and Salvation

### **10. Why did Jesus have to die — couldn’t God just forgive us?**
> “Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.” — *Hebrews 9:22*  
> “He was wounded for our transgressions… and by His stripes we are healed.” — *Isaiah 53:5*  

God is both just and loving. Sin required judgment — Jesus took that judgment for us.

---

### **11. Why is there only one way to God through Jesus?**
> “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” — *John 14:6*  
> “There is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” — *Acts 4:12*  

Jesus is the only mediator who reconciles humanity to God because He alone was sinless and divine.

---

### **12. What happens to those who never hear about Jesus?**
> “The Lord… is a righteous judge.” — *Psalm 7:11*  
> “The gospel… is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes.” — *Romans 1:16*  

God is fair and merciful. Every person will be judged according to the truth they have received, but salvation is found only in Christ.

---

### **13. Why are some Christians hypocritical?**
> “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven.” — *Matthew 7:21*  
> “By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.” — *John 13:35*  

The Bible warns against hypocrisy. True followers of Jesus strive to live by His Spirit and love others sincerely.

---

## About the Bible

### **14. Isn’t the Bible just written by men?**
> “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God.” — *2 Timothy 3:16*  
> “Holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.” — *2 Peter 1:21*  

Though written by men, the Bible’s ultimate Author is God Himself.

---

### **15. What about contradictions in the Bible?**
> “The words of the Lord are pure words.” — *Psalm 12:6*  
> “Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.” — *Matthew 24:35*  

Apparent contradictions arise from misunderstanding context; Scripture harmonizes when studied carefully.

---

### **16. How can we trust ancient manuscripts after so many translations?**
> “The word of our God stands forever.” — *Isaiah 40:8*  
> “Forever, O Lord, Your word is settled in heaven.” — *Psalm 119:89*  

God has preserved His Word faithfully across centuries and languages.

---

### **17. Why does the Bible contain violence and judgment?**
> “The Lord is slow to anger and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked.” — *Nahum 1:3*  
> “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne.” — *Psalm 89:14*  

God judges evil because He is just — yet always offers mercy first.

---

## About Life and Purpose

### **18. What is the meaning of life — why are we here?**
> “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.” — *Ecclesiastes 12:13*  
> “You are worthy, O Lord… for You created all things.” — *Revelation 4:11*  

We exist to love, know, and glorify God, and to live in fellowship with Him forever.

---

### **19. Does God really care about me personally?**
> “Cast all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.” — *1 Peter 5:7*  
> “Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.” — *Luke 12:7*  

Yes — God’s love is personal and intimate. He knows you completely and calls you to Himself.

---

### **20. How can I find peace and forgiveness?**
> “Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” — *Matthew 11:28*  
> “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us.” — *1 John 1:9*  

Peace begins when you turn to God, believe His Word, and trust in Jesus Christ.

---

### **21. How can faith make a difference in my life?**
> “The just shall live by faith.” — *Romans 1:17*  
> “Without faith it is impossible to please God.” — *Hebrews 11:6*  

Faith brings hope, direction, and strength — because it connects you to the living God.

## Conclusion
God’s Word answers the deepest questions of the human heart.  
Through Jesus Christ, we see God’s justice and mercy meet — and His desire to restore all who believe in Him.  
> “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” — *John 3:16*
