The Bible reveals that Jesus is the one true God manifested in flesh, and His purpose and love for humanity.  
Here are answers to some of life's hardest questions — drawn directly from the KJV Scripture.

---

## About God's Existence and Nature

### **1. If God is real, why doesn't He show Himself to everyone clearly?**
> "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork." — *Psalm 19:1 KJV*  
> "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead..." — *Romans 1:20 KJV*  

God has already revealed Himself through creation, His Word, and supremely through Jesus Christ, who is God manifested in the flesh. Those who seek Him sincerely will find Him (*Jeremiah 29:13*).

---

### **2. Who is God, and is He one or three persons?**
> "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD." — *Deuteronomy 6:4 KJV*  
> "And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh..." — *1 Timothy 3:16 KJV*  
> "I and my Father are one." — *John 10:30 KJV*  

There is only ONE God, not three persons. Jesus is that one God who manifested Himself in flesh as the Son, works as the Holy Ghost, and was known as Father in creation. Jesus is Jehovah of the Old Testament.

---

### **3. If Jesus is God, why did He pray to the Father?**
> "Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross..." — *Hebrews 12:2 KJV*  
> "For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus." — *1 Timothy 2:5 KJV*  

Jesus prayed as a man, demonstrating His human nature. He was fully God in His divine nature but also fully human. The Father refers to His deity; the Son refers to His humanity. There are not two Gods, but one God with two natures.

---

### **4. How can we believe in God when there's no 'scientific proof'?**
> "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." — *Hebrews 11:1 KJV*  
> "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear." — *Hebrews 11:3 KJV*  

Faith is not blind; it's trust based on God's revealed truth and His works in creation, history, and changed lives. The same Jesus who spoke creation into existence can transform your life today.

---

### **5. Why does God allow evil and suffering?**
> "And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good." — *Genesis 1:31 KJV*  
> "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." — *Romans 5:12 KJV*  

Evil came because humanity chose to disobey God. God allows free will, but He will one day remove all evil (*Revelation 21:4*).

---

### **6. If God is good, why does He send people to hell?**
> "The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance." — *2 Peter 3:9 KJV*  
> "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him." — *John 3:36 KJV*  

God does not desire anyone to be lost. Hell is the result of rejecting His offer of salvation through Jesus Christ, who is the only way.

---

### **7. Why does God require worship — is He proud or insecure?**
> "Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve." — *Matthew 4:10 KJV*  
> "God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth." — *John 4:24 KJV*  

God doesn't need worship — we do. Worship aligns our hearts with truth and reminds us that life centers on Jesus, not ourselves. True worship connects us to the living God who deserves all glory.

---

## About Suffering and Justice

### **8. Why do innocent people, especially children, suffer?**
> "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" — *Genesis 18:25 KJV*  
> "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away." — *Revelation 21:4 KJV*  

We don't see the full picture now, but God promises justice and comfort. He cares deeply and will restore all things in His time.

---

### **9. Why doesn't God stop wars, disasters, and pain?**
> "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world." — *John 16:33 KJV*  
> "Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God." — *Romans 8:21 KJV*  

Evil and suffering are temporary. God is patient, giving humanity time to repent before making all things new.

---

### **10. Why do bad people prosper while good people suffer?**
> "Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb." — *Psalm 37:1-2 KJV*  
> "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." — *2 Corinthians 4:17 KJV*  

Earthly success is temporary, but God rewards righteousness eternally.

---

## About Jesus and Salvation

### **11. Why did Jesus have to die — couldn't God just forgive us?**
> "And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission." — *Hebrews 9:22 KJV*  
> "But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed." — *Isaiah 53:5 KJV*  

God is both just and loving. Sin required judgment — Jesus, who is God manifested in flesh, took that judgment for us. God Himself paid the price.

---

### **12. Why is Jesus the only way to God?**
> "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." — *John 14:6 KJV*  
> "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." — *Acts 4:12 KJV*  

Jesus is the only way because He IS God. There is no other name — not Buddha, not Muhammad, not any title — but the NAME of Jesus alone saves. He alone was sinless, and He alone is the one true God who came to save us.

---

### **13. What must I do to be saved?**
> "Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." — *Acts 2:38 KJV*  
> "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned." — *Mark 16:16 KJV*  

Salvation requires:
1. **Repentance** - Turn from sin to God
2. **Water Baptism in Jesus' Name** - Not in titles (Father, Son, Holy Ghost), but in the NAME (Jesus)
3. **Holy Ghost Baptism** - Receive the Spirit with evidence of speaking in tongues

The Apostles always baptized in Jesus' name (*Acts 8:16, 10:48, 19:5*).

---

### **14. Why baptism in Jesus' name instead of Father, Son, Holy Ghost?**
> "And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him." — *Colossians 3:17 KJV*  
> "Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them... But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women." — *Acts 8:5, 12 KJV*  
> "For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus." — *Acts 8:16 KJV*  

Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are titles, not names. The NAME is Jesus. Every baptism in the book of Acts was done in Jesus' name. Matthew 28:19 tells us to baptize in "the name" (singular), and Acts shows us that name is JESUS.

---

### **15. What is the baptism of the Holy Ghost?**
> "And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance." — *Acts 2:4 KJV*  
> "And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied." — *Acts 19:6 KJV*  

The Holy Ghost baptism is a separate experience from water baptism. The biblical evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance. This is the promise for all believers (*Acts 2:39*).

---

### **16. What happens to those who never hear about Jesus?**
> "The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth..." — *Psalm 9:16 KJV*  
> "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth..." — *Romans 1:16 KJV*  

God is fair and merciful. Every person will be judged according to the truth they have received. However, salvation is found only in the name of Jesus Christ — this is why we must preach the gospel to all nations.

---

### **17. Why are some Christians hypocritical?**
> "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven." — *Matthew 7:21 KJV*  
> "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another." — *John 13:35 KJV*  

The Bible warns against hypocrisy. True followers of Jesus strive to live holy lives by His Spirit and love others sincerely. Judge the doctrine by the Word, not the Word by imperfect people.

---

## About the Bible

### **18. Isn't the Bible just written by men?**
> "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness." — *2 Timothy 3:16 KJV*  
> "For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." — *2 Peter 1:21 KJV*  

Though written by men, the Bible's ultimate Author is God Himself, working through the Holy Ghost.

---

### **19. What about contradictions in the Bible?**
> "The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times." — *Psalm 12:6 KJV*  
> "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away." — *Matthew 24:35 KJV*  

Apparent contradictions arise from misunderstanding context; Scripture harmonizes when studied carefully and prayerfully with the Holy Ghost as teacher.

---

### **20. How can we trust ancient manuscripts after so many translations?**
> "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever." — *Isaiah 40:8 KJV*  
> "For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven." — *Psalm 119:89 KJV*  

God has preserved His Word faithfully across centuries and languages. The KJV is a reliable translation based on the Textus Receptus manuscripts.

---

### **21. Why does the Bible contain violence and judgment?**
> "The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked..." — *Nahum 1:3 KJV*  
> "Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face." — *Psalm 89:14 KJV*  

God judges evil because He is just and holy — yet He always offers mercy first through Jesus Christ.

---

## About Life and Purpose

### **22. What is the meaning of life — why are we here?**
> "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man." — *Ecclesiastes 12:13 KJV*  
> "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created." — *Revelation 4:11 KJV*  

We exist to love, know, and glorify Jesus, who is God, and to live in fellowship with Him forever.

---

### **23. Does God really care about me personally?**
> "Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you." — *1 Peter 5:7 KJV*  
> "But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows." — *Luke 12:7 KJV*  

Yes — God's love is personal and intimate. Jesus knows you completely and calls you to Himself.

---

### **24. How can I find peace and forgiveness?**
> "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." — *Matthew 11:28 KJV*  
> "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." — *1 John 1:9 KJV*  

Peace begins when you turn to God, repent of your sins, are baptized in Jesus' name for remission of sins, and receive the Holy Ghost.

---

### **25. How can faith make a difference in my life?**
> "For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith." — *Romans 1:17 KJV*  
> "But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him." — *Hebrews 11:6 KJV*  

Faith brings hope, direction, and strength — because it connects you to the living God, Jesus Christ, who is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

---

## About Holiness and Living for God

### **26. Do I have to live holy after I'm saved?**
> "Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord." — *Hebrews 12:14 KJV*  
> "But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy." — *1 Peter 1:15-16 KJV*  

Yes. Salvation is not a license to sin. The same Jesus who saves us also sanctifies us. Living holy is not legalism — it's loving obedience to the God who saved us.

---

### **27. What about speaking in tongues — is it real today?**
> "And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues." — *Mark 16:17 KJV*  
> "For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God..." — *1 Corinthians 14:2 KJV*  

Speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost and continues as a prayer language. It is for today — the promise is for all who are afar off (*Acts 2:39*).

## Conclusion: The Apostolic Message

God's Word answers the deepest questions of the human heart.  
Jesus Christ is the one true God manifested in flesh — He is Jehovah, He is the Father in creation, He is the Son in redemption, and He is the Holy Ghost in the church.

The Apostolic message is simple:
- **REPENT** of your sins
- Be **BAPTIZED in Jesus' name** for the remission of sins (not in titles)
- **RECEIVE the Holy Ghost** with the evidence of speaking in tongues
- **LIVE HOLY** as a child of God

> "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." — *John 3:16 KJV*

Jesus is that one God who loved you enough to come in flesh, die for your sins, and rise again for your justification. There is ONE God, and His name is JESUS.

> "And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins." — *Matthew 1:21 KJV*
