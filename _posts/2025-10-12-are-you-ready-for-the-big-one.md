## Signs of the Times

**When we read the headlines, it is not hard to see that our world is on a downward slide.** Political tensions, natural disasters, earthquakes, and disease outbreaks are escalating. More and more professed believers seem to be falling away from the faith.

**It has caused many people to wonder whether these events are part of biblical prophecy.** I can say with certainty that **we are closer to our salvation than ever before.** Even as the world hurtles toward earth's Last Days, **we can find hope in God's Word.**

## The Earthquake Reality

### Historical Predictions

**Nostradamus, the French astrologer and seer who lived in the 16th century,** is well known for his mysterious prophecies that many people think portend future events. One of Nostradamus' most often cited prophecies for 2025 mentions **"earthquakes" and "overflowing rivers,"** which might be a sign of impending environmental disasters.

### Strongest Earthquakes in Philippine History

1. **Moro Gulf (1976)** - 8.0 Magnitude
   - 5,000 to 8,000 fatalities

2. **Baguio City (July 16, 1990)** - 7.8 Magnitude
   - 1,621 killed
   - 3,000+ injured

3. **Casiguran (1968)** - 7.6 Magnitude
   - 207 fatalities

### Recent Earthquakes in the Philippines

1. **September 30, 2025 - VISAYAS** - 6.9 Magnitude
   - Location: Northern Cebu, near Bogo City
   - Casualties: 75 killed, 1,271 injured

2. **October 9, 2025 - LUZON** - 4.8 Magnitude
   - Location: La Union/Baguio City area

3. **October 10, 2025 - MINDANAO** - 7.6 Magnitude
   - Location: Davao Oriental, Eastern Mindanao

### What Is "The Big One"?

**Recently, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the province of Cebu.** Other than toppling buildings and killing some civilians, the said tremor has triggered new interest and concern on the topic of **"The Big One."**

**The so-called "Big One" is the projected and overdue magnitude 7.2 or stronger earthquake expected to hit Metro Manila in the near future.**

**Key facts about "The Big One":**
- **Expected center:** Along the West Valley Fault
- **Historical pattern:** Major movements occur every 400-600 years
- **Last activity:** Around 1658
- **Current status:** Scientists say the probability is increasing every year
- **Global concern:** Similar megathrust earthquakes are anticipated along Western North America, the Philippines, and Japan

**Are we ready for "The Big One"?**

## The Greater Purpose of This Message

**This message is designed not to give so much emphasis on the occurrences happening in the world today, but to give us an understanding of how we must be living and what we must be expecting.**

> *"Expectation is the birthplace for the miraculous."* — Jeff Arnold

## Living Unhindered

**The book of Acts is a sweeping account of the birth of Christianity.** It begins with the ascension of Christ and ends with the Apostle Paul writing letters while under Roman house arrest.

**It's the story of a handful of disciples who turn the world upside down** with their message of love, forgiveness, and salvation through Christ. It's quite an epic tale, but it may be **the very final word of Acts that leaves us with the greatest clue for how to live as followers of Christ in the modern world.**

### The Power of "Unhindered"

> *"Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him."* — **Acts 28:31**

**"Unhindered" may be the last word of Acts, but it's the first word for those who put their hope, faith, and trust in the risen King Jesus.**

**UNHINDERED:** Able or allowed to happen or continue without being slowed, stopped, or made more difficult. (Walang hadlang - Tagalog)

**UNRESTRAINED:** Walang pigil (rampant, uncontrolled, unbridled) / Hindi mapigil (uncontrollable, ungovernable, irrepressible) / Hindi masawata (uncheckable, unpreventable)

> *"Bravery is the audacity to be unhindered by failures, and to walk with freedom, strength, and hope, in the face of things unknown."* — Morgan Harper Nichols

### The Unhindered Life in Scripture

**Rivers of Living Water:**
> *"In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive...)"* — **John 7:37-39**

**Signs Following Believers:**
> *"And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover... And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following."* — **Mark 16:17-20**

**Extraordinary Power:**
> *"And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women. Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them. There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one."* — **Acts 5:14-16**

## Four Signs of the End Times

### I. The Sign of Deception

**As we move toward the Last Days, Jesus said there would be an increasing danger of deception by false teachers.**

> *"Take heed that no one deceives you. For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many."* — **Matthew 24:4-5**

**More and more people will search for leaders to deliver them,** and they will seek mystics and religious leaders who claim to have deeper knowledge. **Deception may be one of the greatest threats to the Church today, but it is nothing new.**

#### Historical Example: King Josiah's Reforms

**Before the religious reforms of ancient Israel's King Josiah, the priests—God's representatives to the people—set up idols to false gods in the temple** (2 Kings 23:4). And the people willingly participated in this idolatry. **They didn't throw God out of their worship. Instead, they treated Him like He was one of many gods.** The Israelites synthesized their religion with another.

#### Modern Syncretism

**"A spirit of deception is taking hold of our culture."**

**This type of syncretism is rampant in the world today.** Our society is characterized by:
- **A culture of toleration** that works for everybody but Christians
- **Great acceptance** for all sorts of immoral behavior
- **Yet considers it unacceptable** to speak of absolute Truth

**In response, some churches and pastors have departed from sound doctrine.** This isn't just another trend. **It is a spirit of deception taking hold of our culture.**

> *"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables."* — **2 Timothy 4:3-4**

#### The Solution

**For all the deception going on today, we cannot spend our time chasing down every rumor.** Our time is better spent focusing on the solution, and that is Jesus Christ.

> *"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me."* — **John 14:6**

> *"You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."* — **John 8:32**

### II. The Sign of Disputes Among Nations

**Jesus warned His disciples that the end of the age would be marked by "wars and rumors of wars" with nations rising against each other** (Matthew 24:6-7). As dissension escalates, we can view it as a sign of the times.

**The book of Revelation tells us that conflict—ceaseless, unending, terrible war—will fill the Tribulation period,** and it will escalate until the entire world is involved.

#### Global Military Reality

**Many countries live at peace today, but there is a growing sense of instability in international affairs:**
- **50% of all research scientists** are involved in arms development
- **At least one military weapon** and 4,000 pounds of explosives for every person on earth
- **Global military expenditures** grew to 1.92 trillion U.S. dollars in 2019

**As shocking as this may seem, long ago the Bible predicted an escalation of conflict, border skirmishes, race wars, and national battles during the End Times.**

### III. The Sign of Devastation

**Along with the deception and disputes of the Last Days, Jesus warned of "famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places"** (Matthew 24:7).

#### Global Hunger

**We live in a day when we can scarcely turn on the TV without seeing someone trying to raise money to feed the hungry.** Even though God has blessed us with a fruitful, abundant planet, **millions of people in the world face food insecurity and scarcity.**

#### Disease Outbreaks

**COVID-19 has raised global awareness of our vulnerability to novel diseases, but it isn't the only outbreak in our world today.** According to the World Health Organization, there have been recent outbreaks of:
- Yellow fever
- The plague
- Nipah virus
- Meningitis
- Many others

**To make matters worse, "superbugs" are developing resistance to antibiotics.**

#### Increasing Earthquakes

**We are also witnessing an increase in the frequency and intensity of earthquakes:**
- **Between 1900 and 1969:** Roughly 6 major quakes every 10 years
- **Recent data:** "Major earthquakes" now occur more than once a month
- **"Great earthquakes"** shake the globe every year

**All of these devastating trends are signs that point to the imminent return of Jesus Christ.**

### IV. The Sign of Deliverance Into Tribulation

**In the Last Days, there will be an explosion of antagonism toward God's people:**

> *"Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name's sake."* — **Matthew 24:9**

**We are already seeing evidence of this today.**

#### Persecution in Our World

**Headlines carry stories about:**
- **Christian business owners** expected to set aside their beliefs
- **Universities and school boards** passing over Christian faculty members
- **Christianity under attack** everywhere

#### Global Statistics (2021 World Watch List)

**During the reporting period, Open Doors recorded:**
- **More than 340 million Christians** lived under high levels of persecution
- **4,761 Christians were martyred**
- **4,488 churches** and Christian buildings were attacked
- **4,277 believers** were detained, arrested, or imprisoned

**As the Tribulation approaches, many more will pay a high price for living out their faith in our world.**

## Understanding the Olivet Discourse

**The Olivet Discourse is one of the most comprehensive outlines of prophecy in Scripture.** Jesus shared this information so that we could see and understand the times.

> *"See to it that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass."* — **Matthew 24:6**

**Biblical prophecy reminds us that the deception, conflict, devastation, and tribulation of the Last Days is no match for Almighty God.**

**When we experience terrible events like earthquakes, pandemics, and persecution, Scripture reminds us:**
- **God declares "the end from the beginning"** (Isaiah 46:10)
- **His "counsel shall stand"** (Isaiah 46:10)

> *"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory."* — **2 Corinthians 4:17**

## What Should We Do?

### 1. LOOK UP
> *"And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh."* — **Luke 21:28**

**When you see prophetic signs unfolding, don't look down in fear—look up in expectation!**

### 2. LET GOD BE GOD
> *"Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him. As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice."* — **Psalm 68:1-3**

### 3. BE STRONG IN THE LORD
> *"Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you."* — **Isaiah 35:4**

> *"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."* — **Ephesians 6:10-11**

### 4. UNITE, BE HUMBLE, PRAY, SEEK HIS FACE, TURN FROM WICKED WAYS
> *"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."* — **2 Chronicles 7:14**

### 5. REJOICE IN THE LORD
> *"Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand."* — **Philippians 4:4-5**

### 6. THINK POSITIVELY
> *"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things."* — **Philippians 4:8**

### 7. BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT
> *"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord."* — **Luke 4:18-19**

### 8. WORSHIP GOD IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH
> *"A time will come, however, indeed it is already here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father is seeking just such people as these as His worshipers. God is a Spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth."* — **John 4:23-24**

### 9. BE REVIVED
> *"For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones."* — **Isaiah 57:15**

> *"Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee? Show us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation."* — **Psalm 85:6-7**

## Conclusion: Ready for The Big One

**"The Big One" may refer to a coming earthquake, but spiritually, it represents something far greater—the return of Jesus Christ and the culmination of all things.**

**Are we ready for "The Big One"?**

**Not just the potential earthquake that seismologists warn about, but the greatest event in human history—the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ?**

**The signs are all around us:**
- Deception is increasing
- Nations are in conflict
- Devastation through natural disasters and disease
- Persecution of believers is escalating

**But we are not called to live in fear. We are called to live unhindered—with boldness, power, and expectation.**

**Like Paul under house arrest, still preaching the Kingdom "with all confidence, no man forbidding him," we too must live unhindered by circumstances, unshaken by signs of the times, and unafraid of what's coming.**

**The Big One is coming—whether it's a physical earthquake or the return of Christ. The question is: Are you ready?**

**Look up! Your redemption draws near!**

> *"But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only... Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh."* — **Matthew 24:36, 44**

**Be ready. Stay ready. Live unhindered!**
