The Oneness of God is a fundamental doctrine in the United Pentecostal Church and many other Apostolic denominations. It emphasizes the belief that there is only one God, who has revealed Himself in various ways throughout history. This doctrine is rooted in Scripture and is essential to understanding the nature of God and His relationship with humanity.

## Biblical Foundation of Oneness

The concept of the Oneness of God is firmly anchored in the Bible. The Shema, found in **Deuteronomy 6:4**, declares:

> “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.”

This foundational verse clearly affirms the indivisible nature of God. Throughout the Old Testament, God consistently identifies Himself as one, without division or plurality in His essence (Isaiah 43:10–11, 44:6, 45:5). He is not a collection of persons, but a singular divine being who reveals Himself in various roles and manifestations.

## Jesus Christ: The Fullness of the Godhead

The Oneness doctrine holds that **Jesus Christ is the full manifestation of the one true God in flesh**. According to **Colossians 2:9**:

> “For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.”

Rather than being a second person in a triune godhead, Jesus is understood to be **God Himself** incarnate—God coming in human form to redeem humanity. In this view, the terms _Father_, _Son_, and _Holy Ghost_ do not refer to separate persons but to different roles or modes in which the one God operates.

- As **Father**, God is the Creator and sustainer of all things.
- As **Son**, He manifested in flesh for the purpose of redemption.
- As **Holy Spirit**, He works in the hearts of believers today.

These are not distinct persons but distinct manifestations or offices of the same divine being.

## Historical Context

The early church held a strong monotheistic belief rooted in Judaism. The idea of God’s oneness was not controversial among the earliest believers. However, as Christianity spread into the Greco-Roman world, philosophical interpretations began to influence theology. The doctrine of the Trinity, which describes God as three co-equal persons, developed over time, culminating in creeds such as the Nicene Creed in 325 AD.

Oneness believers contend that this was a departure from the biblical revelation of God’s nature. The return to apostolic teaching, they argue, necessitates a reaffirmation of the singularity of God’s being.

## Practical Implications of the Oneness Doctrine

Understanding God as absolutely one impacts the believer’s **worship, prayer life, and sense of relationship with God**. Oneness theology emphasizes:

- **Praying in the Name of Jesus**, recognizing that all the fullness of God is present in Him.
- **Baptism in Jesus' Name** (Acts 2:38), reflecting the understanding that Jesus is the revealed name of God.
- A deep appreciation for the **incarnation**, knowing that God did not send another being to save us, but came Himself.

This creates a more intimate and personal connection between the believer and God—He is not distant or divided, but fully accessible through Jesus Christ.

## Conclusion

The Oneness of God is not just a doctrinal stance—it is a profound truth that shapes how believers view God, salvation, and their spiritual identity. It affirms that **God is one**, **Jesus is that one God manifest in the flesh**, and that this understanding is not only biblical but transformative. To know the Oneness of God is to see the unity of His purpose, the clarity of His revelation, and the power of His presence in the life of every believer.
