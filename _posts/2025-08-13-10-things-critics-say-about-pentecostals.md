## Introduction: Embracing Our Pentecostal Identity

**We are privileged and honored to be part of the Apostolic Church.** Our beliefs, our way of worship, and our identity as Pentecostals set us apart. While we may have attended different churches before, **there is something distinctly different when you attend an Apostolic service** - the way we worship with our whole heart and in holiness.

**Tonight we address the common criticisms directed at Pentecostals** - not to be defensive, but to understand the biblical foundation of our beliefs and practices. **Are you proud to be Pentecostal?** Let us examine what critics say and respond with Scripture.

## Criticism #1: "They Are Too Emotional and Loud"

**Critics say we are too emotional and too loud in our worship.** And you know what? **It's true - we are loud, and we're not sorry about it!**

### Biblical Foundation for Expressive Worship

> *"Praise Him with the timbrel and dance; praise Him with stringed instruments and flutes. Praise Him with loud cymbals; praise Him with clashing cymbals!"* — **Psalm 150:4-5**

**The Bible itself encourages us to be loud in our worship!** When we use instruments - guitars, drums, cymbals - is it quiet? **Of course not!** Even the Bible encourages us to be loud in terms of our worship and praise.

**There is nothing wrong with being loud, especially when our noise has meaning** - when our loudness is for praising our Lord. **Never be sorry that you are loud. Be proud that you belong to a loud generation** - loud in worship, loud in praise.

### The Value of Emotion in Faith

**Being emotional is not a bad thing.** It is part of our being - we have physical, spiritual, mental, and **we also have emotional aspects.** There is nothing wrong with emotions, especially when those emotions are directed toward our Lord God.

**When we think of everything God has done in our lives, how can we not be emotional?** Our expressions of emotion toward God are natural and biblical responses to His goodness.

## Criticism #2: "They Always Want to Get You Baptized"

**Critics say that Pentecostals always talk about baptism** - that we constantly encourage people to be baptized in water, claiming their previous baptism was wrong if it wasn't done in Jesus' name.

### The Apostolic Command for Baptism

> *"And now why are you waiting? Arise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord."* — **Acts 22:16**

**Even Apostle Paul encouraged people not just to believe, but to arise and be baptized** because it will wash away sins. **Baptism is not just a religious tradition** we need to follow, but **baptism is a constant scenario in the Bible, giving significance to our personal faith with the Lord.**

**Baptism is not a culture thing. Baptism is not a religious thing. Baptism is a heavenly thing!** That's why we share with people the importance of being baptized - we shouldn't be ashamed because **we know this is what our Lord desires, as it washes away our sins.**

**There's nothing wrong with constantly talking about baptism** because we know the true baptism that washes away our sins in the proper name and manner.

## Criticism #3: "They Always Emphasize Receiving the Holy Spirit"

**Critics say we are always emphasizing receiving the Holy Spirit** - that we teach people cannot enter the kingdom of heaven without being filled with the Spirit and speaking in tongues.

### Christ's Own Teaching on the Spirit

**Even our Lord Jesus Christ Himself said we need to be born again of water and of the Spirit** to enter the kingdom of God. **It's not a religious thing, but it's a heavenly thing** to serve God and receive the Holy Spirit.

> *"For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call."* — **Acts 2:39**

**This is a promise from the Lord!** As stated in the book of Joel: **"And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh."**

### Faith and Obedience Work Together

**It's not the speaking in tongues that saves us** - it's our saving faith. But **because we have faith, we obey.** And since we obey, we receive the promise. **Not the speaking in tongues that saves us, but it is our faith** that moves us to obey and receive God's promise.

## Criticism #4: "Even If They Believe in Jesus, You Still Ask Them to Receive the Holy Ghost"

**Critics say that even when people claim to believe in Jesus, we still insist they need to receive the Holy Spirit.**

### The Apostolic Example

> *"Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed?"* — **Acts 19:2**

**Not everyone who believes will be saved.** That's why in Acts 19, when Apostle Paul encountered the disciples of John the Baptist who claimed to believe in Jesus Christ, **Paul still asked if they had received the Holy Spirit.**

**Even though they believed, it wasn't enough.** We need to receive the Holy Spirit because **even the disciples of John the Baptist were commanded to be baptized and receive the Holy Spirit.** **Faith without works is dead faith** - we cannot just believe and do nothing.

---

## Criticism #5: "They Insist on Using the Name of Jesus for Everything"

**Critics say Pentecostals are obsessed with using Jesus' name for everything** - even to the point of wanting to re-baptize people "the Bible way."

### The Power of the Name

> *"And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."* — **Colossians 3:17**

**If we must do everything in Jesus' name, shouldn't baptism** - which is such a significant part of our faith - **also be done in Jesus' name?**

> *"Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."* — **Acts 4:12**

**If there is no other name that can save us except Jesus' name, then this name must be used** in all spiritual matters, especially baptism.

### Baptism Signifies Ownership

**In the Old Testament, to be baptized in someone's name meant you belonged to that name.** Baptism signifies ownership. **When we are baptized in Jesus' name, we belong to Him** - our lives are no longer ours but His.

---

## Criticism #6: "They're All About Church Attendance, Bible Study, and Doctrine"

**Critics say Pentecostals focus too much on church attendance, Bible readings, laying hands on people, and doctrine.**

### The Biblical Command to Study

> *"Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine."* — **1 Timothy 4:13**

**God commands us to give attention to reading, preaching, and studying doctrine.** The Bible continues: **"Do not neglect the gift that is in you... Meditate on these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all."**

**By studying God's Word and doctrine, you will save both yourself and those who hear you.** When you study the Bible, you know what's forbidden, you know what's wrong, you know God's ways.

**It's shameful when Christians attend church without bringing their Bibles** and after 20 years in church, still don't know basic verses. **God is commanding us to search the Scriptures and meditate on them.**

## Criticism #7: "They're Always Preaching About Giving and Giving Up Things"

**Critics say we always preach about giving and giving up things, ignoring God's grace.**

### Grace and Works Together

**We are saved by grace - this is true.** But **grace doesn't mean we do nothing.** We cannot just believe and that's it, because **true faith produces works.**

> *"If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me."* — **Mark 8:34**

**Grace is God's part, but we also have our part.** Without our part, grace will not be complete or effective. **Grace is unmerited favor** - you don't deserve it, but God gave it to you. **But it doesn't mean we have nothing to do.**

> *"For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age."* — **Titus 2:11-12**

**Grace teaches us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts** and live righteously. **Grace is grace - we are saved by grace - but if we do not do our part, it will be ineffective.**

---

## Criticism #8: "They Don't Follow Jesus' Command About Baptism Formula"

**Critics question why we don't follow Jesus' words about baptizing "in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit."**

### Understanding Apostolic Authority

**Jesus gave authority to the apostles, especially Peter.** In Matthew 16:18-19, **Jesus gave Peter the keys, saying whatever he binds on earth will be bound in heaven.**

> *"When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."* — **Acts 19:5**

**Should we believe Apostle Peter? Yes, we should believe him because he was given authority** by our Lord Jesus to handle spiritual matters. **When Peter said to be baptized in Jesus' name, he wasn't making a mistake** - he had the authority given to him.

**Besides, there's no contradiction between Matthew and Acts** - this is a topic for another study.

## Criticism #9: "They Constantly Talk About Apostles' Doctrine"

**Critics say we constantly talk about the apostles' doctrine and claim there is only one gospel message.**

### The Authority of the Apostles

**After the apostles received the Holy Spirit, they received power from on high.** Therefore, **there's no reason not to follow the apostles because they received power from God.**

> *"We are of God. He who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error."* — **1 John 4:6**

**The apostles said: "We are of God, and those who know God will listen to us."** Those who truly know the Lord will listen to the apostles, **and those who don't know our Lord won't listen to us.**

> *"But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed."* — **Galatians 1:8**

**If anyone preaches another gospel other than what the apostles preached, let them be cursed.** The gospel we teach comes from the apostles' gospel - outside of it, it doesn't come from God's gospel.

## Criticism #10: "They Believe Jesus is Literally the Father"

**Critics say Pentecostals believe the Son Jesus Christ is literally the Father.**

### The Mystery of Godliness

**We Pentecostals understand there is only one God** - only one who created heaven and earth, only one God acknowledged by Israel. **Because He is only one, this one God manifested Himself in flesh.**

> *"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up in glory."* — **1 Timothy 3:16**

**The mystery of godliness is that God was manifested in the flesh.** When it says "God was manifest in the flesh," **it's not referring to another deity or just "the Son" - but to the one true holy God of Israel who manifested Himself in flesh.**

**We believe this God manifested in flesh is Jesus Christ.** Our clue is "received up into glory" - **no one came from earth and ascended to heaven except Jesus Christ alone.**

### The Word Who Was God

> *"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world did not know Him."* — **John 1:1, 10**

**The Word who is God came into the world** that He made, but the world didn't recognize Him. **This Word who is God is Jesus Christ** - the one true living God manifested in flesh.

**The word "Son" in the Bible pertains to the flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ, not His deity.**

## Conclusion: Blessed to Be Pentecostals

**We are so blessed to be Pentecostals!** Visit Baptist churches, Methodist, Adventist, Catholic, Iglesia ni Cristo, Jehovah's Witnesses - **you will never feel the presence of God there like you do here on Sundays.**

**God can move regardless of your religion** - if you're Methodist, Baptist, Adventist - but when God moves, **He will lead you to the right path and help you find the truth.**

**Most importantly, we are not Pentecostals for nothing** - **we are Pentecostals because we love God and we love His people.**

**Let us stand and applaud our Lord** - let our applause be for our God!

> *"But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light."* — **1 Peter 2:9**

**We are blessed to be called out of darkness into His marvelous light as Pentecostals - defending our faith with Scripture and living boldly for His glory!**
