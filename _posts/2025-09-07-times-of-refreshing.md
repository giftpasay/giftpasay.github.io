## The Ultimate Refreshment

**What is the most refreshing thing you can think of?** For some, it might be a cold Coke or a cup of coffee. For others, after working hard and perspiring, a tall glass of iced milk tea hits the spot. Still others find nothing like cool, refreshing water to invigorate them.

**There are many refreshing experiences in life:**
- **Laughter is refreshing** - the joy of the Lord is our strength
- **Singing can refresh you** - lifting your spirit through worship
- **Even good hard labor** can be refreshing, especially if you sit behind a desk all day

**But of all the refreshing experiences we can find, nothing can compare to the renewal of the mind and spirit that is found in the presence of God.**

> *"Times of refreshing; Here in Your presence / No greater blessing; Than being with You / My soul is restored; My mind is renewed / There's no greater joy Lord; Than being with You"*

**The message is quite simple: We can be continually refreshed, if we will live in right relationship with God.**

## Understanding Biblical Refreshing

**In biblical terms, "refreshing" refers to the renewal, restoration, or revitalization of the spirit, soul, or body.** It is often associated with:
- **The presence of God**
- **The work of the Holy Spirit**
- **The encouragement found in fellowship with believers**

**Refreshing can be both a physical and spiritual experience**, providing relief from weariness and a renewed sense of purpose and strength.

## Old Testament Foundation

### The Sabbath Principle
> *"For six days you are to do your work, but on the seventh day you must cease, so that your ox and your donkey may rest, and the son of your maidservant may be refreshed, as well as the foreign resident."* — **Exodus 23:12**

**The Sabbath serves as a divine provision for physical and spiritual renewal.** God designed rest and refreshment into the very fabric of creation.

### The Shepherd's Restoration
> *"He restores my soul..."* — **Psalm 23:3**

**This speaks of spiritual refreshing that comes from God's guidance and care.** Like a shepherd who leads sheep to still waters, God provides restoration for our weary souls.

### Renewed Strength
> *"Those who wait upon the Lord will renew their strength; they will mount up with wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary; they will walk and not faint."* — **Isaiah 40:31**

**This passage highlights the refreshing strength that comes from trusting in the Lord.** Waiting upon God brings supernatural renewal and vitality.

## New Testament Revelation

### The Promise of Refreshing
> *"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you."* — **Acts 3:19-20**

**Peter speaks of times of refreshing that come from:**
- **Repentance and conversion**
- **The presence of the Lord**
- **The anticipation of Christ's return**

**In speaking of "Times of Refreshing," Peter referred to the time when Jesus will return and rule in righteousness.** The ultimate times of refreshing will be fulfilled when Jesus Christ returns in glory. **In a lesser (though glorious) sense, God sends times of refreshing to His people today.**

### Fellowship Refreshment
> *"For I have had great joy and comfort and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, my brother."* — **Philemon 1:7 AMP**

**The Apostle Paul often speaks of the refreshment that comes from fellowship with other believers.** We can be sources of refreshing to one another through love and encouragement.

## Physical Refreshment: The Lame Man's Healing

**In Acts 3:1-10, we see a powerful example of physical refreshing through divine intervention.**

### The Setting
- **Peter and John went to the temple** at the hour of prayer (3 PM)
- **A lame man from birth** was carried daily to the Beautiful Gate
- **He asked for alms** from those entering the temple

### The Miracle
> *"Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk."* — **Acts 3:6**

**Peter offered something far more valuable than money** - the healing power of Jesus Christ. **The man's feet and ankle bones immediately received strength**, and he began walking, leaping, and praising God.

**This physical healing brought complete refreshment** - not just to his body, but to his entire life situation.

### Lessons from the Storm
> *"They that go down to the sea in ships... mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble... Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm..."* — **Psalm 107:23-31**

**Even in life's storms, when we cry out to the Lord, He brings refreshment by:**
- **Calming the storm** around us
- **Bringing us to our desired haven**
- **Demonstrating His goodness** and wonderful works

## Spiritual Refreshment: The Living Water

> *"If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water."* — **John 7:37-38**

**Jesus offers spiritual refreshment through:**
- **Living water** that never runs dry
- **The Holy Spirit** who provides ongoing vitality
- **Rivers flowing from within** - abundance, not just sufficiency

### Rest for the Weary
> *"Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."* — **Matthew 11:28-30**

**Jesus extends a personal invitation to those who are weary and burdened**, promising not just physical rest but **rest for their souls** - the deepest kind of refreshment.

## The Power of Refreshing Times

**"Times of Refreshing might not change your circumstance, but The Holy Spirit has the Power to use it to change you."**

### Three Ways the Holy Spirit Uses Refreshing Times

#### 1. To REVIVE
**Times of Refreshing serve to breathe life and hope back into us.** When we feel spiritually dead or hopeless, God's refreshing presence revives our spirit and renews our hope.

#### 2. To RENOVATE
**Times of Refreshing serve to freshen our focus on the purpose that God has for us to fulfill.** Like renovating a house, God refreshes our vision and clarifies our calling.

#### 3. To REPLENISH
**Times of Refreshing serve to restore a fresh supply of:**
- **Strength** for the journey ahead
- **Peace** in the midst of turmoil
- **Joy** despite circumstances
- **Confidence** in God's faithfulness
- **Hope** for the future

## How to Stay Fresh and Refreshed

**Four practical ways to maintain spiritual refreshment:**

### 1. Personal Times of Worship
**Regular, intimate worship keeps our spirits fresh.** When we focus on God's goodness and greatness, our perspective is renewed and our hearts are refreshed.

### 2. Prayer
**Communication with God is essential for ongoing refreshment.** Through prayer, we:
- **Pour out our hearts** to God
- **Receive His peace** and guidance
- **Experience His presence** personally

### 3. Reading the Word of God
**Scripture is a source of constant refreshment.** God's Word:
- **Renews our minds** with His truth
- **Strengthens our faith** through His promises
- **Provides guidance** for daily living

### 4. Surrounding Ourselves with People That Bring Refreshing
**Fellowship with encouraging believers is vital.** We need people in our lives who:
- **Build us up** in faith
- **Speak life** over our situations
- **Point us back** to God's goodness

## Living in Continuous Refreshment

**The key to experiencing times of refreshing is maintaining right relationship with God.** This involves:

### Regular Spiritual Disciplines
- **Consistent worship** and praise
- **Daily prayer** and communion with God
- **Regular study** of God's Word
- **Active fellowship** with believers

### Repentance and Faith
**As Acts 3:19 teaches, refreshing comes through repentance and turning to God.** We must:
- **Acknowledge our need** for God's refreshing
- **Turn away from** anything that hinders our relationship with Him
- **Trust in Jesus Christ** as our source of renewal

### Expectant Faith
**We must believe that God wants to refresh us.** His heart is always to:
- **Restore** what has been broken
- **Renew** what has grown weary
- **Revive** what seems dead

**God's invitation stands open today:** "Come unto Me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest."

**Whether you need:**
- **Physical healing** and strength
- **Emotional restoration** and peace

- **Mental clarity** and hope

**Times of refreshing are available in the presence of the Lord.** They come not through our own efforts or abilities, but through:
- **Repentance** and turning to God

- **The work** of the Holy Spirit
- **Fellowship** with other believers

**The ultimate times of refreshing await us when Jesus returns in glory, but God graciously provides refreshing times for us today.** Don't wait until you're completely depleted - **come regularly to the Lord for the refreshment your soul needs.**
