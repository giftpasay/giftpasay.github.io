## Living in a Messed-Age

**Our world and our country are in turmoil.** It is in a mess - a great mess. Surprisingly though, some say there is plenty of evidence that our quality of life is better today than ever. **This progress, however, has come at a high cost, and our way of life is not sustainable. We are living in a Messed-age!**

**MESS:** A disordered, untidy, offensive, or unpleasant state or condition, usually because of blundering, laxity, or misconduct. A dirty or untidy state of things; a situation or state of affairs that is confused or full of difficulties.

## The State of Our World

### Global and National Challenges

**What is the biggest problem in the world in 2025?** Our world faces unprecedented challenges:

**The Philippines continues to experience alarming issues:**
- **Over-exploitation of resources**
- **Deforestation and land degradation**
- **Climate change effects**
- **Various forms of pollution**

### The Top 7 Social Problems in the Philippines

1. **Poverty** - widespread economic hardship
2. **Inequality** - growing gaps between rich and poor
3. **Crime** - rising violence and lawlessness
4. **Lack of access to healthcare** - medical care remains inaccessible to many
5. **Unemployment** - joblessness affecting millions
6. **Inadequate housing** - homelessness and substandard living conditions
7. **Environmental degradation** - destruction of natural resources

### Current Crisis: Flood Control Controversy

**Since 2024, allegations of corruption, mismanagement, and irregularities** in government-funded flood management projects have been occurring. The controversy centers on:
- **Billions of pesos** allocated but misused
- **"Ghost" projects** that exist only on paper
- **Substandard construction** endangering lives
- **Contracts cornered** by favored contractors

**In response, protests against alleged corruption** were conducted in commemoration of the 1972 declaration of martial law.

### The September 21 Rally Context

**Mass demonstrations were held on Sunday, September 21.** The date coincides with the anniversary of martial law imposition by President Ferdinand Marcos in 1972 - a symbolic choice for groups emphasizing democratic rights and government accountability.

**The so-called "Trillion People/Peso Rally" at Luneta** raises the question: **As members of the church in these times, "What shall we say? What can we do today?"**

> *"Do you not know that the saints (God's people) will one day judge the world? If the world is to be judged by you, are you not competent to try trivial cases?"* — **1 Corinthians 6:2 AMP**

### Our Response to Authority

> *"Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist have been put in place by God. Therefore whoever resists governmental authority resists the ordinance of God."* — **Romans 13:1-2 AMP**

**While we submit to authority, we must also recognize our higher calling** to proclaim God's message in these troubled times.

### International Day of Peace

**September 21 is also known as the International Day of Peace.** Established in 1981 by unanimous United Nations resolution, Peace Day provides a globally shared date for all humanity to commit to peace above all differences and contribute to building a culture of peace.

## I. The Biblical Description of Our Times

> *"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away."* — **2 Timothy 3:1-5**

**The Bible identified these times as:**
- **Perilous** (KJV)
- **Terrible** (NIV)
- **Difficult** (NASB)
- **Times of stress** (RSV)
- **Grievous** (ASV)
- **Great stress and trouble** (AMP)

**The world is clearly in a mess, exactly as God's Word revealed it would be.**

### What Should We Expect?

**As the Church of Jesus Christ living in these days, we must be "looking up, for our redemption draweth nigh."** Expect greater things coming.

**What are you expecting these days? What are we anticipating to take place?**

**Anticipation:** A feeling of excitement about something that is going to happen in the near future.

**Powerful quotes on expectation:**
- *"Expectation is the birthplace of the miraculous"* — Jeff Arnolds
- *"I want to have such revivals that even the devil prays for the rapture!"* — Wayne Huntley

## II. These Are the Days to Minister God's Message

> *"This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."* — **1 John 1:5**

**These are the days to minister or proclaim God's message for this Messed-age!**

### 1. The Oneness of the One True God

**The message of the truth about the One True God is a message that must be proclaimed these days.**

> *"Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour."* — **Isaiah 43:10-11**

**Scripture clearly reveals God's oneness:**

> *"And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life."* — **1 John 5:20**

> *"One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all."* — **Ephesians 4:5-6**

**Paul's example at Mars Hill:**

> *"Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious. For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you."* — **Acts 17:22-23**

**Paul preached Jesus! Baptism is in the name of the One True God.**

### 2. God's Invitation to Come

> *"Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool."* — **Isaiah 1:18**

> *"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls."* — **Matthew 11:28-29**

**God's invitation is open to all who are weary and burdened.**

### 3. New Life in Christ

> *"Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things have passed away. Behold, new things have come."* — **2 Corinthians 5:17 AMP**

> *"For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ."* — **Galatians 3:27 AMP**

**In Christ, we experience complete transformation and renewal.**

### 4. Message of Salvation

**YOU CAN BE SAVED BY PREACHING:**
> *"For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."* — **1 Corinthians 1:21**

**THE GOSPEL SAVES:**
> *"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved..."* — **1 Corinthians 15:1-2**

**KEYS TO THE KINGDOM:**
> *"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call."* — **Acts 2:38-39**

**JESUS SAID: BE BORN AGAIN!** (John 3:3-7)

### 5. For the Church (Apostolic Believers)

> *"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."* — **Revelation 2:29**

**The Spirit is speaking specific instructions to the church in these last days.**

#### Continue Steadfastly
> *"And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles... And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved."* — **Acts 2:42-47**

**The early church model remains our blueprint:**
- **Apostles' doctrine** - sound biblical teaching
- **Fellowship** - genuine community
- **Breaking of bread** - communion and shared meals
- **Prayers** - consistent intercession

#### Continue in What You've Learned
> *"But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them."* — **2 Timothy 3:14**

> *"Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee."* — **1 Timothy 4:16**

#### Grow in Grace
> *"Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."* — **2 Peter 3:17-18**

#### Walk in Wisdom and Understanding
> *"See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit."* — **Ephesians 5:15-18**

**Practical wisdom includes:**
- **Speaking in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs**
- **Making melody in your heart to the Lord**
- **Giving thanks always for all things**
- **Submitting to one another in the fear of God**

#### Walk in the Spirit
> *"This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh... If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."* — **Galatians 5:16-18, 25**

#### Prepare for the Rapture
> *"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope... For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words."* — **1 Thessalonians 4:13-18**

#### Save by All Means
> *"For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!... I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some."* — **1 Corinthians 9:16, 22**

**Paul's approach to evangelism:**
- **To the Jews, he became as a Jew**
- **To those under law, as under law**
- **To those without law, as without law**
- **To the weak, he became weak**
- **All to save some by any means possible**

#### Support the Ministry

**Four ways to support your church and pastor:**

1. **RESPECT AND HONOR YOUR PASTOR** (1 Thessalonians 5:12-13)
2. **FOLLOW HIS LEAD** (Hebrews 13:17)
3. **SUPPORT FINANCIALLY** (Luke 10:7, 1 Corinthians 9:4, 6:14)
4. **PRAY WITHOUT CEASING** (Acts 12:5, 1 Thessalonians 5:25)

## What Is God's Message for You Today?

### LIFT JESUS HIGHER!

> *"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me."* — **John 12:32**

**When we lift Jesus higher, He draws people to Himself.** Our primary mission in this messed-age is to exalt Christ above all the chaos and confusion.

### The Charge to Ministry

> *"I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry."* — **2 Timothy 4:1-5**

**Paul's charge to Timothy remains our charge today:**
- **Preach the word** - make it your priority
- **Be instant** in season and out of season - always ready
- **Reprove, rebuke, exhort** - speak truth boldly
- **With all longsuffering and doctrine** - be patient and sound
- **Watch in all things** - stay alert and vigilant
- **Endure afflictions** - persevere through trials
- **Do the work of an evangelist** - fulfill your calling
- **Make full proof of your ministry** - complete your assignment
