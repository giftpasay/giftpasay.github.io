## The Call to Grow and Multiply

**As we see the day approaching, waiting for the coming of the Lord, it is definitely the will of God for us—the church—to grow more, shine, and multiply** to the point that people would want to be a part of and be a member of such.

**If we would look at the early church in the book of Acts, we would clearly see the secrets of its advancement, influence, and continuous growth.** A major part of it is that they continued steadfastly in fellowship; they balanced the use of their wings.

**Our main goal as a church is not just numerical growth for corporate worship, but we must produce disciples.**

**EVERYONE IS (MUST BE) A DISCIPLE.**

## Christianity: From Lifestyle to Enterprise

**"In Jerusalem, Christianity was a lifestyle. In Rome, it became an institution. In Europe, it became a culture. In America, it has become an enterprise. In the Apostolic Church, CHRISTIANITY IS THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE!"**

**This powerful statement reveals how Christianity has transformed—or been transformed—through the centuries.** The question for us today is: **What is Christianity in our lives?**

### The Need for Change

> *"I am convinced that the traditional church worldwide is being slowly replaced by an act of God."* — Ralph Neighbors

**God is doing something new.** The question is: Will we be part of it, or will we resist it?

## Three Kinds of People

**"There are three kinds of people in the world:**
- **The Few who make things happen**
- **The Many who watch things happen**
- **The Vast Majority who do not know what is happening"**

**Where do you belong?**

### The Parable of Buddy the Mule

**Buddy is blind.** If he thought that he was the only one pulling, he wouldn't even try. Doesn't that sound like folks you've known?

**It seems like it's just hard to get some people involved in the work of God.** No matter how hard we try, their excuses never end. It is amazing that some won't get involved unless they know that they are not alone!

**Like the farmer with Buddy, you have to beg and plead before you get the response you desire.**

**An unknown author said:** *"People are like sticks of dynamite; the power is on the inside but nothing happens until the fuse gets lit."*

**What will light your fuse? What will activate your potential?**

## Member vs. Disciple

**Greek Terms:**
- **Member:** "melos" 
- **Disciple:** "mathetes"

### Characteristics of a MEMBER

**A member may or may not be:**
- **Involved** in ministry or service
- **Name written in the church roll** but not necessarily in God's book
- **Member of the physical church** but not of the spiritual body of Christ
- **Indifferent** to spiritual matters
- **Uncooperative** with church vision and direction
- **One who belongs to a whole but remains just a part**

**A member shows up but doesn't step up.**

### Characteristics of a DISCIPLE

**A disciple of Christ is:**
- **A learner** - constantly growing in knowledge
- **An apprentice** - being trained and mentored
- **Adherent** - sticking close to Christ
- **Follower** - walking in Jesus' footsteps
- **Obedient** - doing what Christ commands
- **Involved** - actively engaged in ministry
- **Loyal** - faithful through all circumstances
- **Disciplined** - lives with purpose and order
- **Bears his cross** - willing to suffer for Christ
- **Fisher of men** - actively evangelizing
- **Continuing in His word** - committed to Scripture
- **Loves one another** - demonstrates Christ's love
- **Has authority** - operates in spiritual power
- **Name written in the book of life** - assured of salvation
- **HAS A DISCIPLE/S** - reproducing spiritually

**A disciple doesn't just attend—they advance the Kingdom!**

## What Is Discipleship?

**DISCIPLESHIP:** "A process of intentional, continual, progressive following, learning and surrendering of lives to the Lordship of Jesus Christ."

**We are called not just to be members... We are called to be disciples!**

> *"Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age."* — **Matthew 28:19-20 NLT**

**Notice the command:** MAKE DISCIPLES, not just make converts or members.

## How Discipleship Can Help Us

**What is a disciple?** (Webster: one who accepts and assists in spreading the doctrines of another)

**DISCIPLESHIP thus means the art of learning, teaching, or mentoring.**

### Six Benefits of Discipleship

#### 1. We Grow at the Same Time
**Both the disciple and the discipler grow together.** Teaching someone else deepens your own understanding and commitment.

#### 2. Effective Way to Train Leaders and Ministers
**Discipleship is the biblical model for leadership development.** Jesus didn't start a seminary—He made disciples who made disciples.

#### 3. Alleviates Burden
**Discipleship makes ministry bearable** by distributing the load among many rather than placing it all on one person.

#### 4. Everybody Is Involved
**No one sits on the sidelines.** Everyone has a role, everyone contributes, everyone matters.

#### 5. Closing the Backdoor
**When people are discipled and involved, they don't leave as easily.** Connection and purpose create commitment.

#### 6. Avoids a One-Man Leader
**Discipleship prevents unhealthy dependence on a single leader** and creates a sustainable, multiplying ministry.

## Understanding the Shift

**TO SHIFT means:**
- To exchange for or replace by another: CHANGE
- To change the place, position, or direction: MOVE
- To make a change in place

**Shifting is not about abandoning what's good—it's about moving to what's better!**

## Why Must GIFT Shift?

> *"The only person who can stop you from becoming what God intends you to become is YOU!"* — John C. Maxwell

**We are our own greatest obstacle to growth and transformation.**

**Consider this:** "Most people only use about 10% of their potential; if they use as much as 25%, they are called geniuses. If we can go from using 10% of our potential to using 20%, we could double our productivity and still have 80% of our potential untapped."

**What would happen if we unleashed more of God's potential in our lives?**

## Breaking Down DISCIPLE-SHIFT

**"A process of intentional, continual, progressive following, learning and surrendering of lives to the Lordship of Jesus Christ."**

**Let's examine each component:**

### PROCESS (noun)
- A series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end
- Performing a series of operations to change or preserve something
- A systematic series of actions directed to some end
- A continuous action, operation, or series of changes taking place in a definite manner

**Discipleship is not an event—it's a process. It takes time, patience, and consistency.**

### INTENTIONAL (adjective)
- Performed by or expressing intention
- Done deliberately; intended
- Of or relating to intention or purpose

**Discipleship doesn't happen by accident.** It requires deliberate action and purposeful investment.

### CONTINUAL (adjective)
- Recurring regularly or frequently
- Not interrupted; steady
- A process that requires continual monitoring

**Discipleship is not a one-time training but an ongoing relationship** and commitment.

### PROGRESSIVE (adjective)
- Moving forward; advancing
- Proceeding in steps; continuing steadily by increments
- Open to or favoring new ideas, policies, or methods
- Increasing in rate as compound interest increases; exponential growth

**Discipleship produces measurable growth and forward movement** in spiritual maturity.

## Four Stages of Disciple-Making

**THE SCIENCE OF DISCIPLE MAKING - EXPERIENTIAL:**

### Stage 1: INFANCY
**Basic spiritual disciplines:**
- **Prayer (Devotion)** - establishing a prayer life
- **Personal Bible Reading** - consuming God's Word
- **Worship Service Attendance** - connecting with the body

**This is the newborn stage** where foundational habits are formed.

### Stage 2: CHILDHOOD
**Expanding involvement:**
- All of Infancy stage, PLUS:
- **Regular Attendance** - consistency in commitment
- **Giving** - stewardship and generosity
- **Soul-winning** - sharing your faith

**This is the growing stage** where you begin to participate actively.

### Stage 3: ADOLESCENCE
**Deeper commitment:**
- All of previous stages, PLUS:
- **Active Involvement** - serving in ministry
- **Prayer & Fasting** - deeper spiritual disciplines
- **Disciple-Making** - reproducing yourself in others
- **Teaching** - sharing knowledge with others

**This is the maturing stage** where you become a multiplier.

### Stage 4: PARENTHOOD
**Full spiritual maturity:**
- All of previous stages, PLUS:
- **Leadership (Mentoring)** - guiding others
- **Ministerial Responsibilities** - carrying the weight of ministry

**This is the reproducing stage** where you raise up spiritual children who raise up spiritual children.

**Where are you in this journey?**

## The Biblical Foundation

**What is a disciple?** A learner and/or follower of another person.

**Thayer's Definition:** "A learner, pupil, disciple... one who follows one's teaching..."

**TFD:** "Learner, pupil, disciple... generally pupil, apprentice (in contrast to the teacher)... disciple, adherent..."

### The Success Question

**Ted Engstrom said:** "Success means a person is reaching the maximum potential available to him at any given moment."

**If success is tapping into the available potential that we have and making the best use of it—shouldn't Christians be more successful than non-Christians?**

**We have all these things through the power of God's Spirit that should enable us to live on a higher plane. The question is: "Where are we (you) now?"**

## Envisioning the Future

**Let's envision the desired future of GIFT Church family:**

**Three to five years from now, what do we see?**
- How many disciples have been made?
- How many leaders have been raised up?
- How many new ministries have been birthed?
- How much has the Kingdom expanded?

**Five to ten years from now, should the Lord tarry, in what state will GIFT be when the next generation takes our place?**

**The answer depends on the choices we make today:**
- Will we remain merely members, or will we become disciples?
- Will we consume, or will we contribute?
- Will we watch, or will we work?
- Will we multiply, or will we stagnate?

## The Challenge: Are You a Member or a Disciple?

**The question is not:**
- How long have you been in church?
- How much do you know about the Bible?
- How many services have you attended?

**The question is:**
- Are you actively following Jesus?
- Are you learning and growing?
- Are you surrendering more of your life to His Lordship?
- Are you making disciples who make disciples?

**You cannot be a disciple without being a disciple-maker.** Jesus' command wasn't just to be a disciple—it was to MAKE disciples.

## Conclusion: Chosen and Appointed

> *"You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you and I have appointed and placed and purposefully planted you, so that you would go and bear fruit and keep on bearing, and that your fruit will remain and be lasting, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name [as My representative] He may give to you."* — **John 15:16 AMP**

**You were not chosen to sit—you were chosen to produce.**  
**You were not appointed to consume—you were appointed to reproduce.**  
**You were not planted to remain—you were planted to multiply.**

**God has:**
- **Chosen you** - selected you for His purposes
- **Appointed you** - given you a specific assignment
- **Placed you** - positioned you strategically
- **Purposefully planted you** - established you with intention

**All so that you would:**
- **Go** - take action, move forward
- **Bear fruit** - produce results, make disciples
- **Keep on bearing** - continue reproducing
- **Have lasting fruit** - create sustainable multiplication

**This is not optional—it's your calling, your purpose, your destiny.**

**The shift from member to disciple is not just about what you do—it's about who you become.** And who you become determines who you reproduce.

**Today, GIFT Church is making a shift. The question is: Will you shift with us?**

**Will you move from:**
- **Spectator to participant?**
- **Consumer to contributor?**
- **Member to disciple?**
- **Follower to leader?**
- **Blessed to blessing?**

**The choice is yours. But know this: God has called you to more than membership. He has called you to discipleship. And through discipleship, He will accomplish exceeding abundantly above all we can ask or think.**

**It's time for the GIFT Disciple Shift. Are you ready?**

And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age."* — **Matthew 28:19-20 NLT**

**Go. Make. Teach. Multiply. This is our calling. This is our mission. This is our shift.**
