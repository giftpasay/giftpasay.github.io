## Introduction

> “Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.  
Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it?  
I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.”  
Isaiah 43:18-21 (KJV)

> “For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.  
Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.  
And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.”  
Jeremiah 29:11-13 (KJV)

## Proposition

The beginning of 2026 is the perfect time to reset our minds, examine our habits, and prepare our hearts for what God is about to do next.

Each of us has developed patterns of behavior that shape our daily routines. After a year marked by uncertainty and testing, the question is not whether God will move, but how we will begin this year in response to Him.

## Bridge

The times demand our best. We must not allow distractions to destroy the purpose of our existence, which is to honor, serve, and glorify the Lord Jesus Christ in everything we do.

Like Queen Esther, we can say with confidence that we have come to the Kingdom for such a time as this (Esther 4:14).

The past year tested our character and faith in unprecedented ways. We survived by God’s grace, but survival alone was not enough. God also gave us wisdom, ability, and responsibility to move forward.

## In 2026, for Us to Have Maximum Impact, Let Us:

---

### I. Remember Who We Are

#### Who Am I?

- **Ephesians 2:11-22 (KJV)**  
Once far off, now brought near by the blood of Christ. No longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God. Built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone.

- **John 15:16 (KJV)**  
We did not choose Him. He chose us and ordained us to bear fruit that remains.

- **1 Peter 2:4-5 (KJV)**  
Living stones built into a spiritual house and a holy priesthood.

- **1 Peter 2:9-10 (KJV)**  
A chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people.

Remember who you are.  
“Lord, remember Your people, remember Your children, remember Your promise, O God.”

#### Remember Whose You Are

> “You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body.”  
1 Corinthians 6:19-20 (KJV)

---

### II. Fix Your Eyes on Jesus

> “Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.”  
Hebrews 12:1-2 (KJV)

Keeping Jesus at the center of your life allows you to remove distractions and entanglements. This discipline transforms how you live.

Ask yourself:  
What desires are preventing me from centering my life completely around Jesus?

Jesus is the center of it all.

---

### III. Know How This Story Ends

> “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose.”  
Romans 8:28 (KJV)

We are not biological accidents. We are creatures of destiny.

God has elevated His church. We are blessed beyond measure. We are the head and not the tail. We have been upgraded in Christ. From nothing to something. From nobody to somebody. You are a child of God.

In chaotic times where security is valued like gold, the church must understand God’s will and remain faithful to its calling.

We are confident because we know how this story ends.

- “If God be for us, who can be against us?” (v.31)
- “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?” (v.35)
- “In all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us.” (v.37)

### Understanding the Process

**Process** refers to gradual development toward a result.

> “To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.”  
Ecclesiastes 3:1 (KJV)

> “What has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel.”  
Philippians 1:12

Returning to basics is not regression. It is alignment.

**Breakthrough Defined**
- A sudden advance
- A notable success
- Moving through an obstacle
- Breaking past resistance

“Instead of having a breakdown, I’m focusing on having a breakthrough.” Terrell Owens

Isaiah 43:18-19 (KJV)

> “I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.”  
Philippians 3:13-15 (KJV)

> “Ye are complete in Him.”  
Colossians 2:8-10 (KJV)

> “The joy of the LORD is your strength.”  
Nehemiah 8:10 (KJV)

> “Put on the whole armour of God.”  
Ephesians 6:10-13 (KJV)

> “Fight the good fight of faith.”  
1 Timothy 6:11-12 (KJV)

> “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.”  
2 Timothy 4:7-8 (KJV)

This year, we move forward.  
Not casually.  
Not carelessly.  
But with purpose, identity, endurance, and faith.

March forward.  
Make maximum impact.
