**Scripture Ref: 1 Peter 3:15 (AMP)**

> "But in your hearts set Christ apart [as holy--acknowledging Him, giving Him first place in your lives] as Lord. Always be ready to give a [logical] defense to anyone who asks you to account for the hope and confident assurance [elicited by faith] that is within you, yet [do it] with gentleness and respect."

## Introduction

In our world, many beliefs compete for acceptance. Most people have not heard the Apostolic message, and when they do hear it they often have questions. How should Christians respond to these questions?

## Three Principles for Answering Questions

### First: Be Prepared to Answer

We should be prepared to answer everyone about our faith (I Peter 3:15). If someone is sincerely seeking truth, we need to explain what we believe from the Bible and confirm truth with our personal testimony.

### Second: Answer According to Understanding and Need

We should answer according to a person's spiritual understanding and need. Many people do not have the background for a full explanation of truth. Some need milk instead of meat (Hebrews 5:12-14). If they need to be saved, we can share the truth about faith, repentance, and a personal experience with God while deferring some discussions of doctrine and discipleship.

### Third: Discern Motives

We need to discern people's motives and answer accordingly. Some people aren't seeking truth but want to attack or ridicule. In such cases we have no obligation to answer in the way they wish. We are to avoid foolish and contentious questions (II Timothy 2:23; Titus 3:9). Jesus said not to waste what is holy on those who aren't holy, or throw pearls to pigs (Matthew 7:6). He also told us to be wise as serpents (careful and shrewd) but harmless as doves (without guile or malice) (Matthew 10:16).

## Jesus' Example: Responding to Different Types of Questions

### Responding to Hostile Questions

When some Jewish religious leaders asked Jesus by what authority He acted, He responded with a question of his own: Did the baptism of John come with authority from Heaven, or was it merely human? (See Matthew 21:23-25.) They were not sincerely seeking truth but sought to discredit Him, so He asked a counter question to expose their hypocrisy. They didn't want to say John's baptism came from God, because they hadn't received it. On the other hand, if they denied that John's baptism came from God, the common people would reject them, for they acknowledged John as a prophet. Therefore, the leaders refused to answer.

John had pointed to Jesus, so if they admitted that John's authority came from God, then they would understand that Jesus' authority also came from God. Jesus' answer revealed and thwarted their hidden agenda, but it would have led them to truth had they been sincere.

### Addressing Deceptive Questions

When the Sadducees posed a puzzling question about the resurrection, Jesus bypassed their detailed scenario and went to the root of the matter. They did not actually believe in the resurrection but were trying to trick Jesus. He pointed out their fundamental problem: they did not believe in the teaching of Scripture or in the power of God. (See Matthew 22:23-33.) They had already rejected truth and so weren't prepared to understand; nevertheless, He gave them a scriptural answer.

### Answering Sincere Questions

A Pharisee asked a direct question: Which is the greatest commandment? Although he was trying to trap Jesus, the question itself was fair and important. Thus Jesus answered plainly and even elaborated: "The greatest commandment is to love God, and the second is to love people." (See Matthew 22:34-40.)

## Recognizing Hidden Assumptions

It is important to be aware of assumptions or definitions hidden in a question. The classic example is: "Have you stopped beating your wife?" If a man answers yes, he admits to past wrongdoing. If he answers no, he admits to present wrongdoing. The question is unfair.

Similarly, some questions are framed in a way that contradicts a scriptural viewpoint. For instance, some may imply that we are intolerant because we affirm God's Word. In our secular culture the highest value is "tolerance" rather than truth. Tolerance is good when it means respecting other people, their civil rights, and their power of choice. However, tolerance has been redefined to mean all beliefs and lifestyles are valid.

## Addressing Questions About Tolerance and Acceptance

Anyone who says some choices are wrong or sinful is labeled "intolerant." Thus, some may ask: Do you believe certain lifestyles are wrong? Do you believe certain people are going to Hell? Does your church accept everyone? If they are sincerely seeking truth, we can explain God's plan according to Scripture. Often the purpose of such questions is to discredit the church, however, and in this case we need to challenge the faulty assumptions.

Contrary to their implications, love doesn't negate truth, acceptance doesn't require approval, mercy doesn't eliminate the need for righteousness, and upholding truth doesn't mean hating unbelievers. God loves everyone, we respect everyone as created in God's image, and we welcome everyone to attend our church. At the same time, we teach God's plan for the human race as revealed in Scripture. We don't define people by an orientation, lifestyle, or predisposition (temptation).

Instead, we treat each person as an individual who has the potential to fulfill God's plan in his or her life by God's grace. God has given us authority to proclaim His Word, but He alone has authority to judge individuals. Like Jesus, we don't condemn people, but we offer them God's salvation (John 3:17). We should redirect the questions back to God's plan while deferring individual judgment to God at the end of a person's life.

## The Ultimate Answer

God empowers us to change our old way of life. He replaces it with something far better: a personal relationship with Him, an abundant life. His plan is always best for us. Jesus is "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6), and in Him we find the ultimate answer to life's questions.
