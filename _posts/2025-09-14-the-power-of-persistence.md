## The Parable of Persistent Prayer

> *"And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint; Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary."* — **Luke 18:1-3**

**Jesus told this parable with a specific purpose: that men ought always to pray and not faint.** The story features an unjust judge who feared neither God nor man, yet he eventually granted justice to a persistent widow simply because she refused to give up.

> *"And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily."* — **Luke 18:6-8**

**The central truth:** If an unjust judge will eventually respond to persistence, **how much more will our loving heavenly Father answer the persistent prayers of His children!**

## God's Delays Are Not God's Denials

**"God's delays, are not God's denials."** He clearly sees, hears, and feels the brokenness and heartaches of His children. **He knows and has allowed for a season what the enemy has done and is doing against His people, the object of His love.**

> *"I tell you that He will defend and avenge them quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find this kind of persistent faith on the earth?"* — **Luke 18:8 AMP**

**Jesus is looking for persistent faith** - the kind that doesn't give up when the answer seems delayed.

## The Unjust Judge: A Lesson in Persistence

**This judge was a bad character.** He didn't fear God or regard man, but he did something right and lawful when pressed by persistence. **The message we can clearly see is that men ought always to pray and not stop. Be persistent in prayer!**

**Key principles from this parable:**
- **Pray and not faint** - don't give up when answers seem delayed
- **Pray without ceasing** - maintain consistent communication with God
- **The privilege, power, and potential of prayer** is the greatest force on earth
- **When we pray, God will be involved** - the Lord God will work!

**There is nothing more powerful than a praying saint of God. Much more, a praying church - a persistent praying church!**

### Powerful Quotes on Prayer
- *"There's nothing that can stop a man and a woman of God who knows how to intercede and knows how to pray!"* — A. Mangun
- *"Your prayers have the power to heal your past and shape your future"* — V. Mangun
- **Weepers and Warriors are the powerful frontliners of the Apostolic Church today!**

**The Seven P's of Prayer:** Presence, Praise, Purpose, Petition, Pardon, Protection, and **Persistence**.

## Understanding Persistence

**Persistence:** *Firm or obstinate continuance in a course of action in spite of difficulty or opposition.* — Oxford Dictionary

*The quality that allows someone to continue doing something or trying to do something even though it is difficult or opposed by other people.* — Britannica

### Historical Examples of Persistence

**Steve Jobs showed persistence.** Even after losing everything he worked for his entire life, he did not give up. Instead, he showed persistence and kept working toward his goal of changing the world through technology.

**Calvin Coolidge (30th U.S. President) said:** *"Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On!' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race."*

### People Who Persisted Despite Obstacles

**Many have achieved greatness through persistence despite disabilities:**
- **Ludwig van Beethoven** became deaf at 30 and composed his greatest works after losing his hearing
- **Helen Keller** was deaf and blind from 19 months old, yet wrote 12 books and earned a Bachelor's degree
- **Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder** achieved musical greatness despite blindness
- **James Earl Jones** overcame stuttering to become known for his powerful voice
- **Marlee Matlin** won an Academy Award despite being deaf
- **Itzhak Perlman** became a virtuoso violinist with paralyzed legs from polio
- **Terry Fox** ran across Canada as an amputee with cancer

**The point is clear: Never give up on prayer! Be persistent! Never stop praying.**

## The Meaning of God's Vengeance

**The word "avenge" means to rectify, vindicate, reimburse.** It means that God will make it right. He will pay back. **God is going to rectify, vindicate, reimburse for:**
- **Whatever prayer you have prayed**
- **Whatever tear you have shed** 
- **Every day you have fasted**
- **Every hour you have lifted your hands and praised Him**

**God is going to avenge you, and not only will He do it - He will do it speedily!**

**There is going to be an answer to prayers, and it will happen so fast that it will leave the devil dizzy and the church of Jesus dancing while the devil is screaming.**

### Biblical Definitions
- **Vengeance:** Punishment inflicted or retribution exacted for an injury or wrong
- **Avenge:** To inflict harm in return for an injury or wrong done to oneself or another; to inflict harm on behalf of someone previously wronged

## Biblical Examples of God's Speedy Vengeance

### I. The Vision That Will Come

> *"And the Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry."* — **Habakkuk 2:2-3**

**Though it tarries, wait for it because it will surely come.**

> *"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."* — **Galatians 6:7**

**If you prayed, believed, stayed true, and obeyed God, there will be a revival, an answer, and a breakthrough because God is not mocked.**

> *"Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not."* — **Jeremiah 33:3**

> *"Be not weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."* — **Galatians 6:9**

**Let us stand firm in faith, knowing that we are going to reap.**

### II. Israel Avenged by God

**After 430 years, God Almighty brought Israel out of Egyptian bondage.** He brought 3-6 million Jews out of bondage in one night! Yes, He did it in one night. **All the years of praying, all the years of believing were wrapped in one great moment!**

> *"And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows."* — **Exodus 3:7**

> *"And the Lord spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me."* — **Exodus 8:1**

**Consider God's power:**
- **God can answer all your prayers in 30 seconds**
- **He can turn our church around in one weekend**
- **He can bring the backsliders back in one day**
- **He can save our friends and loved ones in an instant**
- **They are not lost forever; they will not go to hell**
- **We believe God has given us extraordinary power over the enemy**

### III. The Devil Cast Out of Heaven

**When God had enough of the devil and his rebellion, He threw him out of heaven.**

> *"And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven."* — **Luke 10:18**

**He cast him out of heaven at about 186,000 miles per second.** It didn't take Him long to get rid of him.

> *"Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you."* — **Luke 10:19**

**The devil is a liar.** If the devil could kill you, you would not be alive today - he would have already done it. If the devil says he can tear our church up, it's a lie! **This church is predestined for victory, glory, revival, and growth.**

### The Ultimate Speedy Change

> *"Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."* — **1 Corinthians 15:51-52**

**In a moment, God is going to raise every Apostolic saint who died in faith.** Death is not a demotion but a promotion because the dead in Christ shall rise first. **It will not take God too long to get us out of here.**

**There will be a day when every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. This is God's speedy vengeance. He will rectify, vindicate, reimburse, and pay back - and He will do it speedily!**

## The Enemy's Biggest Mistake

> *"But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."* — **1 Corinthians 2:7-8**

**The enemy's biggest mistake was not understanding God's plan.** Had they known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.

## Revival in Our Times (R.I.O.T.)

**The time for revival is now; the place for revival is here; the way for revival is to pray and read your Bible!**

> *"And the Lord spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me."* — **Exodus 8:1**

## How to Develop Persistence

**Seven practical steps to develop persistence:**

1. **Decide what you want to accomplish and set goals**
2. **Prepare for obstacles and setbacks**
3. **Take the first step**
4. **Review, reevaluate, and revise**
5. **Garner support and encouragement**
6. **Maintain focus**
7. **Enjoy!** The greatest feelings of accomplishment derive from knowing you've overcome obstacles and conquered adversities to achieve your goals

## Leave Vengeance to God

> *"Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave the way open for God's wrath and His judicial righteousness; for it is written in Scripture, 'Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,' says the Lord. But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for by doing this you will heap burning coals on his head. Do not be overcome and conquered by evil, but overcome evil with good."* — **Romans 12:19-21 AMP**

**Don't take matters into your own hands.** Leave room for God's vengeance and overcome evil with good.

## Comfort in the Coming

> *"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words."* — **1 Thessalonians 4:15-18**

## Standing in Hope

> *"Therefore I will look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me. Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me."* — **Micah 7:7-8**
