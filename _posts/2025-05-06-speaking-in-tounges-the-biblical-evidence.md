One of the most distinctive marks of the Pentecostal experience is **speaking in tongues**—a miraculous sign of the infilling of the Holy Ghost. But far from being a modern phenomenon or emotional outburst, speaking in tongues is a **biblical pattern** found throughout the New Testament. It is the initial, outward evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit and continues to be a vital part of the believer’s spiritual life.

## What Is Speaking in Tongues?

Speaking in tongues (glossolalia) is the **supernatural ability to speak in a language unknown to the speaker**, as enabled by the Holy Ghost. It is not learned or imitated—it is Spirit-empowered.

## Tongues in the Book of Acts

The **Book of Acts** provides the clearest pattern for receiving the Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues:

- **Acts 2:4** – _“And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.”_
- **Acts 10:45–46** – _“…on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. For they heard them speak with tongues…”_
- **Acts 19:6** – _“…the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.”_

In each of these cases, tongues were **the immediate, recognizable sign** that someone had received the Holy Ghost.

## Jesus Foretold This Experience

Jesus Himself foretold the experience of tongues as a sign:

> “And these signs shall follow them that believe… they shall speak with new tongues.” — _Mark 16:17_

On the Day of Pentecost, this prophecy was fulfilled. The 120 believers spoke in tongues, and thousands were added to the Church as a result of that supernatural manifestation.

## Paul’s Teaching on Tongues

Paul, in **1 Corinthians 12–14**, discusses the **gift of tongues** within the Church. It’s important to distinguish between:

- **Tongues as the initial evidence** of receiving the Spirit (for all believers).
- **The gift of tongues** for use in public worship, which operates with interpretation and edification.

Paul himself declared:

> “I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all.” — _1 Corinthians 14:18_

Far from discouraging tongues, Paul endorsed and practiced them.

## A Sign and a Blessing

Speaking in tongues is:

- A **sign** of the new birth (John 3:8).
- A means of **prayer in the Spirit** (Romans 8:26; Jude 1:20).
- A channel for **spiritual refreshing** (Isaiah 28:11–12).

Tongues are not optional—they are a vital and consistent part of the New Testament experience with God.

## Conclusion

Speaking in tongues is not merely tradition—it is **truth**. It is the **biblical evidence** of receiving the Holy Ghost and an ongoing source of spiritual power and connection with God.

> “For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people…” — _Isaiah 28:11_

God still fills believers with the Holy Ghost today—and they still speak in tongues, just as they did in the Book of Acts.
