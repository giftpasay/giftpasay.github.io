## 🌿 Bible Q&A

---

## ❓1. Why did God kill many people in the Old Testament?

**Answer:**  
Because God is **holy and just**, and He cannot allow sin and evil to continue unchecked.  
In the Old Testament, when people or nations became deeply wicked — committing violence, idolatry, or child sacrifice — God judged them, but only **after great patience** and many warnings.

> “The LORD is slow to anger but great in power; the LORD will not leave the guilty unpunished.” — *Nahum 1:3*

Even when He judged, God always showed **mercy** — saving Noah from the Flood, sparing Rahab in Jericho, and offering repentance to Nineveh.  
These judgments reveal **how serious sin is** and prepare us to understand Jesus, who took that judgment upon Himself at the Cross.

## ❓2. Why did God create man and put the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the garden?

**Answer:**  
Because God wanted a **real relationship** with mankind — one based on **love, not control**.  
He gave humans the **freedom to choose** Him, symbolized by the two trees in Eden:

- 🌳 **Tree of Life:** Represents eternal life and fellowship with God.  
- 🍎 **Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil:** Represents the freedom to obey or disobey.

Without that freedom, love would be meaningless.  
Adam and Eve’s choice to disobey showed mankind’s desire for independence from God — but even then, God’s mercy was already at work, promising a Savior (Genesis 3:15).  
Through Jesus, the “new Adam,” we are given access again to the **Tree of Life** (Revelation 2:7).

## ❓3. Why does God allow innocent people, especially children, to suffer?

**Answer:**  
Because we live in a **fallen world** — not the perfect one God originally made.  
Sin damaged all of creation, and its effects (disease, disaster, injustice) touch even the innocent.  
But this does **not** mean God is cruel or absent.

God **grieves** with those who suffer — Jesus Himself wept, suffered, and died unjustly.  
He entered our pain so that one day He could **end it forever**.

> “He will wipe every tear from their eyes.” — *Revelation 21:4*

Children who suffer or die are not forgotten.  
God’s mercy is greater than human understanding, and Scripture shows His heart is tender toward the innocent:

> “Let the little children come to me, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.” — *Matthew 19:14*

In the end, God will restore justice, comfort, and peace — and every wrong will be made right.

## ❓4. If God is loving, why didn’t He just stop evil from the beginning?

**Answer:**  
Because to remove evil, God would also have to remove **free will**.  
And without free will, love would be impossible.  
God allows choice — even the possibility of evil — so that real love and trust can exist.  
But He also promises a future where **evil will no longer exist**, and everyone who loves Him will live in perfect peace forever.

> “For now we see only a reflection… but then we shall see face to face.” — *1 Corinthians 13:12*

---

## ❓5. So what does all this show about God’s character?

**Answer:**  
It shows that God is:

- **Holy** — He cannot tolerate sin.  
- **Just** — He judges evil rightly.  
- **Patient** — He gives time to repent.  
- **Merciful** — He forgives and saves.  
- **Loving** — He sent Jesus to take our punishment and restore us to Himself.

Every story in the Bible — even the hard ones — points to this truth:

> “For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son.” — *John 3:16*
