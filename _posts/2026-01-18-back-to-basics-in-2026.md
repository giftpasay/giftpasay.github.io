## Introduction

**Song:** Passion, God You’re So Good

> “And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers…”  
Acts 2:42-47 (KJV)

> “I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called…”  
Ephesians 4:1-6 (KJV)

The early church lived with devotion, unity, generosity, and power. God responded by adding to the church daily those who should be saved. These foundations are not outdated. They remain essential for the church today.

## Proposition

GIFT family, it is time to start a new chapter in the pages of our life’s journey.

“The beginning is the most important part of the work.” Plato

For most people, the most difficult step is the first one. It often involves commitment, whether committing to discipline or letting go of unhealthy habits.

First things must come first. We must learn to prioritize and clearly identify what we should be doing.

“Finishing well is just as important as starting well.”  
It is not how you start, it is how you finish. It is easy to start strong and later lose focus. Passion can fade if it is not guarded.

“Our story may have many endings, but its start is a singular choice we make today.” Faisal Khosa

## Fire @ Bridge

“The only way you can stay on top is to remember to touch bottom and get back to basics.” Shane Black

**Back to basics** means returning to a simpler, biblical way of living and thinking. Change must begin within us. A healthier spiritual life requires restored values such as empathy, tolerance, compassion, trust, love, and obedience.

## Body

### The Focus of Building

- Building Apostolic Saints in the city for the Savior  
- Building Apostolic Saints in the community for the Savior  
- Building Apostolic Saints in the church for the Savior  

---

### I. Apostolic Christians

Apostolic Christians are not ordinary believers. They are believers grounded in the foundation, doctrine, and practices of the apostles.

---

### II. In Doing So, We Must First

#### Remember Who We Are and What He Has Done

- **Ephesians 2:11-22**  
Once far off, now brought near by the blood of Christ. No longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone.

- **John 15:16**  
We did not choose Him. He chose us and ordained us to bear fruit that remains.

- **1 Peter 2:4-5**  
Living stones built into a spiritual house and a holy priesthood.

- **1 Peter 2:9-10**  
A chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people.

Remember who you are.  
Remember His people.  
Remember His promise.

## The Basics

### Apostles’ Doctrine

- Acts 2:42  
- Romans 16:17  
- 1 Timothy 4:13, 16  
- 2 Timothy 4:2-3  

> “There is one body, and one Spirit… One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all…”  
Ephesians 4:1-6 (KJV)

**Foundational Truths:**
- One God (Deuteronomy 6:4-5; Isaiah 43:10-12)
- Born again (John 3:3-7)
- The Gospel (1 Corinthians 15:1-3; Luke 24:45-49; Acts 2:38-39)
- Holiness (Hebrews 12:14)
- Brotherly love (John 13:34-35)
- Unity (Psalm 133:1)
- Faithfulness (1 Corinthians 10:13; Revelation 2:10)
- Fellowship (Hebrews 10:25)

---

### Good Christian Conduct

**1 Thessalonians 5:12-23 (KJV)**

Live with peace, patience, gratitude, prayerfulness, discernment, holiness, and joy.

Observations:
- We live in a world where the enemy is trying to change everything
- The character of the church and nations depends on the character of the family
- Entertainment addiction has altered church culture
- Worship can drift toward performance and showmanship
- God’s commandments transcend time, tradition, and culture
- Focus remains clear: let the church be the church

## GIFT Focus

**Every Member a Minister and a Great Leader**

**Pillar Framework:**
1. Transform – Membership (Orientation, Transformation, Incorporation)  
2. Teach – Maturity (Continuation, Indoctrination, Instruction)  
3. Tap – Ministry (Connection, Ministration, Supplication)  
4. Train – Mission (Management Training, Leadership Development)  
5. Transcend – Multiplication (Celebration, Great Commission, Maximation)  

Growing a church is not easy.
- Good preaching and great music are not enough
- Good doctrine alone is not enough
- Systems deliver the vision
- Growth is not optional
- Churches face an average 6 percent attrition rate

## Principles to Grow By

1. **Commitment**  
Discipleship takes time. Commitment to people matters to God.

2. **Community**  
We are created for relationship. Discipleship is produced through connection.  
John 6:60-69 reminds us to intentionally create environments of belonging and accountability.

3. **Compassion**  
God blesses us so we can bless others.

4. **Contentment**  
Ministry is not meant to be miserable. Success in God’s Kingdom is faithfulness, not numbers.  
To hear Him say “Well done” is the highest goal.

“There is an appointed time in our church when God is going to move mightily. It is going to happen for you.”

---

## Our Priorities

1. **Prayer**  
1 Timothy 2:1-4

2. **Preach and Teach the Truth of God’s Word**  
The Kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of earth will always be in conflict. Government cannot change the world.

3. **Be a Model**  
Acts 2:42-47  
When Apostolic believers live Apostolic lives, the church becomes a powerful witness. What we say and post publicly reflects our testimony.

---

## The Early Church Pattern

Acts 2:42-47 presents a picture of believers living life together through teaching, fellowship, communion, prayer, miracles, generosity, and worship.

They loved, forgave, served, encouraged, exhorted, prayed, equipped, confessed, and cared for one another as one body.

---

## Vision: GIFT Life Groups

**Acts 2:42-47 / Acts 20:20**

Life groups create small, intentional environments where Spirit-led, life-giving experiences can flourish.

> “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.”  
John 13:34-35 (KJV)

The true mark of discipleship is not buildings, programs, or numbers.  
It is love lived out in community.

---

## Conclusion

Back to B.A.S.I.C.S. is not moving backward.  
It is returning to the foundations that allow the church to move forward with clarity, power, unity, and purpose.

If we remain faithful to doctrine, committed to one another, and centered on Christ, we can be confident that our future is secure.
