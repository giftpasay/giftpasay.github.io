## The Divine First of All

**With our theme "Traversing Back to Basics", the first thing, the first subject that we must go back to, is the power of Prayer. This is the Divine First of all.**

**Prayer engages God, Prayer enables God's people, and Prayer enlarges God's kingdom.** Once we have prayed we are ready to do anything; until we have prayed we can do nothing; but once we have prayed, we can accomplish anything!

## The Danger of Prayerlessness

The message opened with a powerful poem illustrating our tendency to rush into our day without prayer:

*"I got up early one morning and rushed right into the day... Problems just tumbled about me, And heavier became each task, 'Why God doesn't help me?' I wondered He answered, 'You didn't ask.'"*

**Prayerlessness is the father of all sins.** We will rise no higher than our Prayers. **Much Prayer—much power; Little prayer—little power; No prayer—No power!** It is just that simple.

## The Foundation of All Great Movements

> *"Every great move of God, can be traced to a kneeling figure."* — **D.L. Moody**

**We win the war when we pray in power because prayer is the battle.** Jesus is the Commander of two armies. One is an army of angels in heaven and one is the army of prayer warriors on earth.

The promise of 2 Chronicles 7:14 serves as the foundation:

> *"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."* — **2 Chronicles 7:14**

## I. The Awesome Power of Prayer

**Prayer is a longing, desire, or need expressed in words to God.** When offered with faith, wholeheartedly, in surrender to the will of God, and from a clean heart, **PRAYER IS POWERFUL!**

**Prayer is Powerful, because it invokes God, who is omnipotent, or unlimited power.** When we pray, we look past our limitations, helplessness and circumstances and look into Jesus, who has all the power and has vast resources.

### Biblical Examples of Prayer's Power

1. **Elijah** – Prayer "avails much" (James 5:16-18). The keyword is AVAIL. We are not wasting our time in praying. God said in Isaiah 45:19, *"I did not say to the seed of Jacob, 'Seek Me in Vain.'"*

2. **Moses** – Moses intercedes and turns God's wrath from the people. Our prayers can even change God's mind (Exodus 32:7-14).

3. **Hezekiah** – God answered Hezekiah's prayer and extended his life (Isaiah 38:1-5). God heard his prayer and seen his "tears." **God sees our tears when we pray.**

4. **Peter freed from prison** – An answered prayer during a prayer meeting (Acts 12:1-16). **God is in the process of answering while we pray.**

## II. The Effectual Fervent Prayer

> *"The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much."* — **James 5:16**

### The Elements of Powerful Prayer

- **PRAYING IN FAITH** - Hebrews 11:6 / James 1:6-8
- **PRAYING WITH A CLEAN HEART** - Psalms 51:10-12 / Proverbs 28:13
- **PRAYING IN THE WILL OF GOD** - James 4:3 / Luke 9:54-56
- **PRAYING IN HUMILITY** - Luke 18
- **PRAYING WHOLEHEARTEDLY** - James 5:16
- **PRAYING IN THE SPIRIT** - Romans 8:26
- **PRAYING WITH THE SCRIPTURES** - Psalms 119:89
- **UNITING WITH OTHERS IN PRAYER** - Matthew 18:19
- **PRAYING PERSISTENTLY** - James 5 / Luke 18:1-8
- **PRAYING IN JESUS NAME** - 1 Samuel 17:45 / Acts 3:6 / Colossians 3:17

## III. Fasting: Added Dimension

> *"Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting."* — **Matthew 17:21**

**Fasting serves multiple purposes in our spiritual life:**

1. **To humble and examine ourselves**
2. **To discipline our flesh**
3. **To Worship**
4. **To seek help for desperate needs**
5. **To focus our attention the Lord**

## IV. Praying in the Holy Ghost

> *"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also."* — **1 Corinthians 14:15**

### The Benefits of Spirit-led Prayer

**Helps our weaknesses:**
> *"Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."* — **Romans 8:26**

**Builds and Strengthens:**
> *"But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost."* — **Jude 1:20**

## V. Standing in the Gap - Intercession

> *"And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none."* — **Ezekiel 22:30**

**God is looking for intercessors** - those who will stand in the gap and pray for others, for nations, and for the lost. **Our intercession has eternal consequences,** even when we cannot see the immediate results.

## VI. As the Hart Panteth

> *"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God."* — **Psalms 42:1**

**Our souls should thirst for God with the same intensity that a deer thirsts for water.** This deep longing should drive us to our knees in prayer, seeking His face above all else.

### Seven Powerful Verses About Prayer

The message concluded with seven encouraging verses about prayer's power:

- **James 5:14-16** - The prayer of faith will save the sick
- **Philippians 4:6-7** - Present your requests to God with thanksgiving
- **Psalm 107:28-30** - He stilled the storm to a whisper
- **John 14:13-14** - Ask anything in Jesus' name
- **Matthew 21:22** - If you believe, you will receive
- **Matthew 7:7** - Ask, seek, knock
- **Mark 11:24** - Believe that you have received

## Greater Revival is Hiding in the 'If'

**Greater Revival is hiding in the 'If' of 2 Chronicles 7:14…**

> *"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."*

**The condition for revival is clear: humility, prayer, seeking God's face, and repentance.** When God's people meet these conditions, **He promises to hear, forgive, and heal.**

## Our Response: A Life of Prayer

**Prayer is our way to communicate with God and helps bring us closer to Him.** To strengthen your prayers, you need to make it a habit and withdraw from distractions. **If you don't know what to say when praying, you can look to the Bible for prayer inspiration.**

**Remember: Once we have prayed we are ready to do anything; until we have prayed we can do nothing; but once we have prayed, we can accomplish anything!**
