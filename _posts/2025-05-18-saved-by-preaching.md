## Saved By Preaching

_Texts: Mark 16:15-16; 1 Corinthians 1:21-23, 2:4; Revelations 1:12-20_

---

## 1. God's Divine Method: The Foolishness of Preaching

> _"For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."_ - **1 Corinthians 1:21**

Pastor Sael reminded us that to the world, preaching seems foolish. It seems like nothing special. But God chose this very thing-this seemingly simple act of proclaiming His Word-as His primary method to save people.

**Key insight:** God didn't choose elaborate rituals, complicated philosophy, or spectacular shows. He chose the simple proclamation of His Word.

## 2. The Power of God's Word

> _"For the word of God is living and active, full of power making it operative, energizing and effective... sharper than any two-edged sword."_ - **Hebrews 4:12**

The Word of God isn't just information-it's alive! It has power to:

- Divide soul and spirit
- Expose our deepest thoughts
- Judge the intentions of our hearts

Pastor Sael emphasized that the Bible defends itself. We don't defend the Word-the Word defends itself through all ages. Our job is simply to declare and emphasize it.

## 3. Preachers Are God's Messengers

When discussing Revelation 1:20, Pastor Sael explained that the "seven stars" represent the angels (or messengers) of the seven churches. These angels are the preachers of those churches-human messengers appointed by God.

> _"The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches."_ - **Revelation 1:20**

Though preachers have authority, they remain under God's authority. They are simply vessels God uses to communicate His message to the church.

**Question to consider:** Do we respect and value the role of God-appointed preachers in our spiritual growth?

## 4. Nothing Replaces the Preaching of God's Word

In our modern times, many things compete for our attention. Pastor Sael warned that nothing should replace the preaching and teaching of God's Word. He said:

> _"I still believe in old-fashioned preaching to save man. Nothing replaces the preaching of the Word of God."_

While many seek wealth, comfort, and pleasure, what people truly need is salvation. The world tries to distract us from this truth, but salvation remains our greatest need.

## 5. The Call to Ministry Is for Everyone

One of the most encouraging parts of the sermon was when Pastor Sael shared stories of how God calls ordinary people:

- Noah was called to build an ark
- Abraham was called from being a Gentile
- Moses thought he couldn't speak well
- Isaiah felt unworthy

> _"The only qualification you need is to be available. Just be available for God anytime He wants to use you."_

God doesn't call the qualified; He qualifies the called. Humility, availability, and willingness are what God looks for.

## 6. The Whole Gospel to the Whole World

Pastor Sael reminded us of our mission: to bring "the whole gospel to the whole world by the whole church."

What is the whole gospel? It's the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 15). This is the message that saves men and women.

> _"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believes and is baptized shall be saved."_ - **Mark 16:15-16**

Our mandate isn't to stay put-it's to go. Even when it's difficult, even when it requires sacrifice, we are called to share this life-saving message.

## The Urgency of Our Times

Pastor Sael closed with a powerful reminder that we're living in desperate times. It's not just the Bible telling us this-everything around us confirms we're in the last days.

> _"It is high time to awake out of our sleep... the night is far spent, the day is at hand."_ - **Romans 13:11-12**

God has a plan for each of us. We may not all be called to preach, but we all have a ministry-a way to partner with God in His work.

---

> _"Search me, O God, and know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts. See if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."_ - **Psalm 139:23-24**

What role is God calling you to play in His kingdom? Are you available and willing to be used by Him? The world desperately needs to hear the gospel message through preaching, God has chosen to save those who believe.

_Let's commit to valuing the preaching of God's Word and discovering our own place in God's plan._
