## Topic: "FORWARD"

**Scripture Ref: Exodus 14:13-14 / Joshua 1:2-9 (KJV)**

## Moving Into Unprecedented Revival

God has blessed us in a greater measure than ever before. The momentum is building, and we are reaching a critical mass for explosive revival. Thus, it is time to move forward into unprecedented revival and growth.

In recent years the UPCI achieved new records for total constituents, ministers, churches, and finances. Truly, we have experienced "greater" things. We should be thankful for these blessings, but we shouldn't be complacent or satisfied. Instead of maintenance mode or survival mode, we need to be in revival mode. There is a Divine Shift. Sometimes we make plans, but they don't develop as we intend. Then God steps in with a better plan and shifts us into a new dimension.

## The Red Sea: Moving Forward in Faith

To inherit the promise and to fulfill the vision, we must move forward. When God delivered Israel from bondage in Egypt, He promised to give them a new land. To inherit the Promised Land, they first had to depart from Egypt. As they left, the Egyptian army pursued them to the Red Sea.

Their situation seemed hopeless. If they didn't move forward they would be captured and killed, yet if they did move forward they would drown. At that crucial moment, Moses spoke the word of God to them: "Do not be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD.... The LORD will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace" (Exodus 14:13-14).

When they called upon the Lord, He told Moses, "Tell the children of Israel to go forward" (Exodus 14:15). At God's command, Moses stretched forth his rod, the waters parted, and the Israelites crossed the sea on dry ground. When the Egyptians pursued them, God rolled the waters back, thus destroying the enemy and delivering His people. It was not enough for them to pray and believe. At the right time, they had to move forward in faith to receive deliverance and victory.

## The Jordan River: Crossing Into the Promise

After crossing the wilderness, the Israelites came to the Jordan River, which was at flood stage. To enter the Promised Land, they had to cross the river. God told their new leader, Joshua, "Arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them" (Joshua 1:2). He gave Joshua three promises:

### Three Promises from God

1. **Possession of the land**
2. **Power to defeat the enemy**
3. **Presence of God to accompany them**

### Three Commands for Success

Then He gave Joshua three commands in order to prosper and succeed: (See Joshua 1:3-9.)

1. **Be strong and courageous**
2. **Obey God's Word without deviation**
3. **Meditate on God's Word**

## Sanctification and Action

In obedience to God's command Joshua instructed Israel, "Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you" (Joshua 3:5). After the people prepared and consecrated themselves, Joshua commanded the priests: "Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over before the people" (Joshua 3:6). When priests moved forward, the people followed. As the priests entered the river, God rolled back the water, and once again the people crossed on dry ground. To receive their inheritance, they had to move forward.

## Faith Requires Action

Faith requires us to act. Faith propels us forward into the will of God. Jesus called His disciples by saying, "Follow Me." To become His disciples, they had to leave their location and their occupation and move forward at His command. (See Matthew 4:19-20; 9:9.) They had to make up their minds and take decisive action to go forward. Then they couldn't look back. They couldn't delay, compromise, or renege on their commitment. (See Luke 9:57-62.)

## Pressing Forward

The apostle Paul explained, "One thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead, I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 3:13-14). To receive what God has promised us, both individually and collectively, we must move forward in the will of God.
