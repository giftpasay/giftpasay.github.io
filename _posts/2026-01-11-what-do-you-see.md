## Introduction

**Song:**  

> “And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.  
For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.”  
Habakkuk 2:2-3 (KJV)

> “Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.”  
Proverbs 29:18 (KJV)

Vision is not optional. It is essential for life, leadership, faith, and purpose. Without vision, people drift, lose direction, and eventually perish.

## Proposition

In a world full of people with great ideas that never come to fruition, the one factor that tilts the odds in your favor is having a clear vision of your future.

A clear vision of what you want in life, whether physical or spiritual, in relationships, business, or faith, becomes the catalyst that separates the wheat from the chaff. Vision distinguishes what is valuable from what is worthless.

Your vision will determine your victory in every area, or your total defeat.

At the beginning of this year, the question is simple and personal. In the near future, what do you see?

## Fire @ Bridge

**Vision** is the faculty or state of being able to see. It is the ability to think about or plan the future with imagination and wisdom. It involves perception, foresight, and anticipation of what is yet to come. Vision can also be prophetic, entrepreneurial, or spiritual. Synonyms include discernment and perception.

Key reflections on vision:

- “It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.” Henry David Thoreau  
- “Be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others.” Roy T. Bennett  
- “Don’t expect people to understand your grind when God didn’t give them your vision.”  
- “The greatest danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we reach it.” Michelangelo  
- “The most pathetic person in the world is someone who has sight but no vision.” Helen Keller  
- “We are limited, not by our abilities, but by our vision.” Khalil Gibran

## Defining Your Vision

To identify your vision and purpose, you must think about two things:
1. What you want to achieve (vision)
2. What is important to you and why (purpose)

Once these are identified and written down, they must be put into action.

A personal vision statement describes your values, strengths, and goals. It may focus on life or professional direction and is meant to orient you toward long-term dreams.

In Scripture, vision often refers to an encounter with God where He imparts revelation through dreams or divine insight. Vision is a God-given mental impression of what can be.

## The Five Main Characteristics of Vision

4. A map  
5. A challenge

## Exploring Principles and Purpose

- The poorest person is one without vision (Proverbs 29:18)  
- Lack of vision leads to stagnation and frustration  
- Many individuals have ideas but struggle to act on them  
- A frustrated person is often one who has abandoned dreams  
- Fear, doubt, and external pressure cause people to deviate from vision  
- God created everyone with unique purpose and potential  
- Fulfilled vision gives meaning to life  
- Education alone does not guarantee success, understanding vision does  
- Everyone has gifts and must take responsibility for developing them  
- Many are born leaders but drift into following  
- Dreams must be realized, not stored as unfulfilled hopes  

Every individual is endowed with vision and gifts to fulfill it. Vision empowers action based on purpose rather than obligation. Persistence is essential in fulfilling God-given purpose.

### Biblical Example: David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17)

David’s victory was rooted in vision.

- The Israelites saw the size of the problem and were afraid (verses 4-11)  
- David saw the solution because of his vision (verses 25-27)  
- He remembered past victories over the lion and the bear (verses 34-37)  
- He used weapons he had tested and trusted (verses 38-40)  

Vision allowed David to see differently when everyone else saw defeat.

Vision can be defined as foresight, insight, and hindsight combined. It is looking forward while understanding the present and learning from the past.

The key to fulfilling purpose is recognizing and activating the vision God has given. Understanding the source of vision reveals its origin and guides the journey from idea to fulfillment. Myles Monroe

If a dream or vision contradicts the Word of God, it is not from the Lord. God never contradicts His Word.  
“The word of the Lord endureth for ever.” 1 Peter 1:25 (KJV)

## The Importance of Vision

In a world full of unrealized ideas, vision is what moves people forward. A clear vision of your future separates those who merely dream from those who act.

Vision brings focus, direction, motivation, and endurance.

## What Does It Mean to Have a Vision?

A vision is a picture or idea in your mind of who you are and what can happen.

The clearer and more defined the vision, the more powerfully it directs thoughts and actions. A strong vision helps overcome obstacles and clarifies why you do what you do.

Vision keeps you focused, motivated, and open to greater possibilities. When you imagine a better future, change becomes easier.

Having vision means knowing who you are now and who you want to become. Without clarity about the present, the future becomes uncertain.

## Personal Reflection

There was a season when vision was unclear. The goal was simply to graduate, then to finish college, then to find a job. Along the way came confusion, distraction, and loss of focus.

At one point, there was no vision, only movement without direction. But when vision became clear again, alignment followed. Goals took shape. Progress resumed.

Vision made alignment possible in both personal life and career.

This reminds us that vision must include physical, emotional, spiritual, and intellectual dimensions. Ask yourself where you want to be in one year, five years, and ten years. Picture it clearly and without limits.

“The only thing worse than being blind is having sight and no vision.” Helen Keller

## The Power of Vision

Everyone should have a vision. If you have one, nurture it. If you do not, begin creating one.

We are easily distracted and forgetful. Keeping vision visible produces focus and results.

Vision inspires action. It attracts ideas, people, and resources. It creates energy, perseverance, and commitment.

When vision is formed, the body releases endorphins that create passion and endurance. These help overcome fatigue and disappointment along the journey.

## Conclusion and Action

> “And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes…  
But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him.”  
Mark 5:1-6 (KJV)

The turning point came when the man saw Jesus.

What you see determines how you respond.  
What you see determines whether you run in fear or run in faith.  
What you see determines whether you remain bound or step into freedom.

The question remains.  
What do you see?
