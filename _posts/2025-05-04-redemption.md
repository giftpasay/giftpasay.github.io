`2 Corinthians 5:15`
> And He died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for Him who died for them and was raised again.

## Introduction:
In the Holy Scripture, we can see that Christ's death on the cross (the offering of blood or giving of life) became the "only way" for us to be redeemed from sin...

`Ephesians 1:7`
> In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace.

...and to receive the benefits of what He did, we need to have faith in Him.

`John 3:16`
> For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.

## I – Redemption, God's plan from the beginning

God became flesh in the person of Christ to provide salvation for humanity (`Hebrews 2:9`). But what He did was not just a sudden solution for man's sin, but rather the fulfillment of His predetermined plan before the foundation of the world.

### The Foreknowledge of God

One of God's attributes that humans don't have is Foreknowledge or advance knowledge of future things.

`Romans 4:17`
> (As it is written, "I have made you a father of many nations") in the presence of Him whom he believed—God, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did.

(Also read: `Isaiah 46:9-10`; `Acts 15:18`)

In His foreknowledge, God saw that the human He would create would sin, and because of this, His purpose in creation would be damaged (`Gen. 1:26-28`; `Isa. 43:7`); because man would certainly go to destruction (`Romans 6:23`; `Psalm 9:17`).

But God in His foreknowledge saw not only man's sin but also the solution to this problem, which is His incarnation as redemption for the sins of the world.

`1 Peter 1:18-20`
> **18** Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver or gold, from your aimless conduct received by tradition from your fathers,
> **19** but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.
> **20** He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you.

`Revelation 13:8`
> All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

(Also read: `Acts 2:23`)

Therefore, before the world and humanity were created, redemption was already in God's mind, He planned it, and it was fulfilled when Christ died on the cross.

## II – The only way of redemption

It is clear in the Bible that sin can only be redeemed through blood, which is equivalent to life.

`Leviticus 17:11`
> For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul.

`Hebrews 9:22`
> And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.

## III – The promised redemption

When man sinned, God immediately declared the promise of the coming Redeemer; and this can be read in Genesis 3:15.

`Genesis 3:15`
> And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.

The seed of the woman referred to here is none other than Christ – `Isaiah 7:14`; `9:6-7`; `Matthew 1:21-23`; `Galatians 3:16`; `4:4-5`.

`Isaiah 9:6`
> For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

`Galatians 3:16`
> Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, "And to seeds," as of many, but as of one, "And to your Seed," who is Christ.

The bruising of the serpent's head is an Eastern phrase meaning the destruction of a leader's lordship. This means that the Devil's claim as lord over sinful man (`John 8:44`; `Romans 6:16`) would end or terminate when the Messiah or Christ (the seed of the woman) comes.

So when Christ came into the world, He fulfilled this purpose (`1 Timothy 2:6`; `3:16`; `Acts 26:18`; `Colossians 1:12-14`; `2:14-15`).

`Colossians 2:14-15`
> **14** Having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us, which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.
> **15** Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it.

The bruising of the heel of the woman's seed represents the temporary suffering that the Devil would inflict on the Messiah or Christ (`Isaiah 53:1-12`; `Acts 2:35-36`; `Hebrews 2:14-15`; `Revelation 1:18`).

`Isaiah 53:5`
> But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed.

The Devil did everything to prevent the appearance of the seed of the woman (Messiah or Christ) because he knew it would be the end of his reign. We can see this in the events recorded in the Bible:

- Cain killing Abel – `Genesis 4`
- The sons of God (Fallen Angels) marrying the daughters of men – `Genesis 6` to corrupt the human race and prevent the pure seed of man – the Savior – from appearing.
- The killing of Israelite male infants during the Pharaoh's time – `Exodus 1`
- Haman's attempt to kill all Jews (Esther and her people) – `Esther 3-4`
- The killing of all infants 2 years old and below, during Herod's time – `Matthew 2`
- And finally, the killing of Christ Himself on the cross of Calvary – `Acts 3:15`

### The Devil's Failure:

Christ's death on the cross was not the Devil's victory but rather his failure, because unknown to him, Christ's death on the cross was the fulfillment of God's plan of redemption for humanity to save it from certain destruction.

`1 Corinthians 2:8`
> Which none of the rulers of this age knew; for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

`Revelation 1:17-18`
> **17** And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, "Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last.
> **18** I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death."

## IV – The shadow of redemption in the Old Testament

In the Old Testament, God gave Israel the ordinance of offerings at the altar, which was the offering of clean animals and the shedding of their blood as a substitute sacrifice for their sins (`Exodus 12`; `Leviticus 1-6`; `Romans 6:23`).

Their offerings were a demonstration of their faith in the coming death of Christ, who is the true offering for our sins (`John 1:29`; `Hebrews 10:1-5`), and obedience to God's plan for salvation.

On the Cross, Christ paid for our sins, and His sacrifice was for the benefit of all people who believe and obey Him (`Galatians 3:13`; `Romans 3:24-26`).

Remember: Man sinned, and God's law demands death as payment for sin (`Ezekiel 18:4`; `Romans 6:23` and `James 1:15`). To provide an appropriate substitute offering, God became flesh to meet the required payment for sin.

`1 Timothy 3:16`
> And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Preached among the Gentiles, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory.

`Hebrews 2:9`
> But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, might taste death for everyone.

Therefore, Christ's death became a substitute offering for our sins (`Galatians 3:13`; `1 Peter 2:24`; `1 John 2:2`). Instead of us dying, Christ died for us. This is the meaning of God's grace (`Ephesians 2:8-9`).

## V – Was Christ's death for all people?

Yes, Christ died for all of us.

`Romans 5:8`
> But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

`2 Corinthians 5:15`
> And He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.

(Also read: `1 John 2:1-2`)

Christ's death for all people is proof that His grace and love are for everyone (`Hebrews 2:9`). This also means that salvation is offered to all, but it's up to each person whether they will accept or reject it.

(`John 3:16` "Whoever", `Mark 16:15-16` "He who believes and is baptized")

**Note:** There are religions claiming that only their group was redeemed or bought by Christ's blood. This claim is based on their wrong interpretation of `Acts 20:28`. It is true that Christ bought the Church with His own blood, but this Church does not refer to a group that only claims the name "Church of Christ" or "Church of God in Christ," but to the assembly of people who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, who were baptized in water in His name and baptized in the Holy Spirit — because this is the only way for us to be included in the body or Church of Christ (`Acts 2:38`; `Galatians 3:25-29`; `1 Corinthians 12:13`; `Colossians 1:18`).

Therefore, the Church that Christ redeemed according to `Acts 20:28` refers to all people who have experienced water baptism and Holy Spirit baptism, and whom He made His Church.

The question is: are they those people? Were they baptized in water in the name of Jesus Christ and in the Holy Spirit? Just because a group uses the name "Church of Christ" or "Church of God" doesn't mean they are the ones referred to in the Bible.

## VI – Three of the most important purposes why Christ died on the Cross:

- **For the atonement or redemption of our sins**  
  `Hebrews 2:9`
  > But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, might taste death for everyone.

- **To destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the Devil.**  
  `Hebrews 2:14`
  > Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil.

- **And to restore man's fellowship with God**  
  (Read: `Ephesians 2:11-17` and `Colossians 1:19-22`)

  `Colossians 1:19-22`
  > **19** For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell,
  > **20** and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross.
  > **21** And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled
  > **22** in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight.

## Conclusion:

Because of Christ's death on the cross of Calvary, we have the opportunity to be forgiven of our sins...

`Matthew 26:28`
> For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.

...and gain hope for eternal life.

`John 3:16`
> For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.

(Also read: `Ephesians 1:7`; `Colossians 1:14`; `Hebrews 9:15`; `Revelation 5:9-10`)
