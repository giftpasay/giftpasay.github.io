## Scripture Reading

> “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”  
2 Corinthians 5:17 (KJV)

Kaya't kung ang sinoman ay na kay Cristo, siya'y bagong nilalang: ang mga dating bagay ay nagsilipas na; narito, sila'y pawang naging mga bago.

> “And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation…”  
2 Corinthians 5:18-20 (KJV)

> “Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh…”  
Ephesians 2:11-13 (KJV)

> “Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God…”  
Ephesians 2:19-22 (KJV)

These scriptures remind us that in Christ, we are no longer who we used to be. We have been reconciled, restored, and repositioned into God’s family.

## Proposition

“Life is a continual upgrade.” J. Mark Wallace  

There is no permanent thing in this world except change.  
“You live, you learn, and you upgrade.” Anonymous  

Because of this reality, one must learn to upgrade not only skills or tools, but also mindset and life direction.

As children of the King of kings and the Lord of lords, our Master, Father, and Lord has given us mandates to fulfill in this ever-changing world. To become who He has called us to be, growth and transformation are required.

### A Modern Illustration: The Global Portal

The first-ever Portal in Asia officially opened in Bonifacio Global City, Manila, on January 21, 2026. This installation connects Metro Manila in real time with other cities around the world.

Existing Portal locations include:
- Vilnius, Lithuania  
- Lublin, Poland  
- Dublin, Ireland  
- Philadelphia, United States  
- Ipswich, United Kingdom  

More portals are expected to open later in 2026, including Piauí in Brazil.

The Portal serves as a living illustration of connection, access, and upgrade. Humanity continues to create new ways to see, connect, and interact beyond limitations.

### Technology Upgrades

Technology constantly changes. In the past, music was played through cassette tapes. Movies were watched on Betamax and VHS. Games were played on Game & Watch, Family Computer, Atari, and Nintendo NES. Phones had long antennas and computers ran on DOS and Windows 3.1.

All of these were once considered advanced. Today, they are outdated.

Times change. Technologies become incompatible with current systems. Eventually, everyone must upgrade. Even when we hesitate, we still replace old phones, systems, and software.

### Then There Is A.I.

Artificial Intelligence, or Artipisyal na Intelihensiya, is the creation of an artificial “mind” for machines. It allows computers to learn, think, and make decisions.

AI helps people search faster, shop smarter, diagnose illnesses, and drive safely. Although modern and futuristic, its purpose should always be for human good, not abuse or compromise of values.

Technology is a tool created by people for people, but responsibility always remains with us.

### We Must Also Upgrade

As believers who have been joined to God and placed into His family, we must upgrade the way we live. This is far more important than any technological advancement.

The old way of living is outdated, corrupt, and incompatible with our new identity in Christ.

> “Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind…”  
Romans 12:2 (KJV)

> “Let us go on unto perfection…”  
Hebrews 6:1 (AMP)

### I. What Do We Mean by Upgrade?

The word “upgrade” originates from the nineteenth century and means:
- To increase to a higher grade or rank  
- To improve quality or usefulness  
- To exchange something for a better version  
- To improve by adding or replacing components  

To upgrade is to make something better, stronger, and more effective. Some upgrade quickly, others wait, but everyone eventually must upgrade.

- “Don’t wait for opportunities, create them with every step you take.” Project of Your Life  
- “Life is a continual upgrade.” J. Mark Wallace  
- “You live, you learn, and you upgrade.” Anonymous

### II. Basic Purposes We Also Need to Upgrade

- **Worship** – Love God with all (Matthew 22:37) – Magnification  
- **Fellowship** – Baptizing them (Matthew 28:19) – Membership  
- **Discipleship** – Teaching them (Matthew 28:20) – Maturity  
- **Service** – Love your neighbor (Matthew 22:39) – Ministry  
- **Outreach** – Go ye (Matthew 28:19) – Multiplication  

We must upgrade how we present the Gospel to everyone.  
This is not a new religion. It is an upgrade, a better expression of the same truth.

Illustrations include:
- Education progression from elementary to higher learning  
- Mobile and gadget upgrades  
- Growth in relationships with God

## Closing Reflection

Just as the world continues to upgrade systems, tools, and technology, the church must also grow in maturity, obedience, and effectiveness.

An upgrade is not about abandoning truth.  
It is about aligning fully with who we already are in Christ.

Old things have passed away.  
All things have become new.

What we need now is not resistance to change, but willingness to grow.

All we need is an upgrade.
