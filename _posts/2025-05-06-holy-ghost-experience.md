The message of the New Testament is clear: **you must be born again**. Jesus declared it plainly in John 3:5:

> “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”

This **new birth** includes water baptism in Jesus’ name and the infilling of the **Holy Ghost**. The Holy Ghost is not just a feeling or a symbolic gesture—it is **God Himself dwelling within** the believer. Receiving the Holy Ghost is essential, transformational, and biblically mandated.

## The Promise of the Holy Ghost

In the Old Testament, the prophets foretold a day when God's Spirit would be poured out:

- **Joel 2:28** – _“I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh…”_
- **Ezekiel 36:27** – _“And I will put my spirit within you…”_

This promise was fulfilled in **Acts 2** on the Day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost was first given.

## The New Birth Explained

Jesus explained to Nicodemus that being "born again" means being born **of water (baptism)** and **of the Spirit (Holy Ghost)**.

- **Water** = baptism in the name of Jesus (Acts 2:38)
- **Spirit** = infilling of the Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues (Acts 2:4)

This new birth experience is how one enters into the **Kingdom of God**—not by religion, tradition, or works, but by **spiritual rebirth**.

## The Role of the Holy Ghost

When a person receives the Holy Ghost:

- They are **sealed** for salvation (Ephesians 1:13).
- They receive **power** to live a holy life (Acts 1:8).
- They experience **divine adoption** as children of God (Romans 8:15).
- They are transformed from the inside out (Titus 3:5).

It is not enough to simply believe intellectually—we must be **born again spiritually**.

## The Pattern in Acts

In every major conversion account in the Book of Acts, the infilling of the Holy Ghost was expected and witnessed:

- **Acts 2** – 120 received the Spirit with tongues.
- **Acts 10** – Cornelius’ household spoke in tongues.
- **Acts 19** – Disciples of John received the Holy Ghost.

This is not a one-time event in history—it is the **New Testament standard**.

## A Personal Experience

The Holy Ghost is not limited to the early Church. It is a **personal promise** to all who believe and obey the Gospel.

> “For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off…” — _Acts 2:39_

Millions today continue to receive the Holy Ghost just as in the Book of Acts—**with the evidence of speaking in tongues**.

## Conclusion

The Holy Ghost is not optional—it is **essential to salvation** and the **gateway to spiritual transformation**. The new birth Jesus spoke of is still available today, and through it, we become new creatures in Christ.

> “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature…” — _2 Corinthians 5:17_

Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?
