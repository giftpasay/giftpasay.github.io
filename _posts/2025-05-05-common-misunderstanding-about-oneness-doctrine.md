The Oneness doctrine is often misunderstood by those unfamiliar with Apostolic theology. Sometimes it’s misrepresented or confused with heresies of the past. To engage in honest discussion and clarify truth, we must address these misunderstandings with Scripture, clarity, and love.

## Misunderstanding #1: Oneness Denies the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

**Truth:** Oneness believers fully affirm the biblical titles of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost—but we understand them as **manifestations of the one God**, not separate persons.

- **Father** — God in creation and relationship.
- **Son** — God in redemption (manifest in flesh).
- **Holy Ghost** — God in action within the Church.

> “The Lord our God is one Lord.” — _Deuteronomy 6:4_

We don’t reject these roles—we **embrace them** and identify the **name** behind them: **Jesus**.

## Misunderstanding #2: Oneness Is Modalism

**Truth:** Modalism, an ancient error, taught that God ceased being Father when He became the Son, and ceased being the Son when He became the Holy Spirit.

Oneness Pentecostals reject this idea. We believe **God is eternally God**, who **can operate in all roles simultaneously**:

- Jesus prayed to the Father as a man, not as a second divine person.
- The Spirit descended at His baptism while the Son stood in the water.

This isn’t multiple gods—it’s **one God acting in multiple ways**.

## Misunderstanding #3: Oneness Denies the Deity of Christ

**Truth:** Oneness doctrine **exalts the deity of Jesus**.

- We believe **Jesus is God**—not part of God, not one-third of God, but the **fullness of the Godhead bodily** (Colossians 2:9).
- He is the **Everlasting Father** (Isaiah 9:6), not merely the Son of God, but **God Himself revealed in flesh**.

Far from diminishing Jesus, Oneness theology proclaims **His supreme divinity**.

## Misunderstanding #4: The Oneness View Is Not Christian

**Truth:** This is perhaps the most unfortunate claim. Oneness believers affirm the full Gospel—Jesus' virgin birth, sinless life, atoning death, resurrection, and return.

We follow the teachings of the apostles and baptize in Jesus’ name, receive the Holy Ghost, and live holy lives. This is not another religion—it is **New Testament Christianity**.

## Misunderstanding #5: Oneness Believers Worship a “Different Jesus”

**Truth:** The Jesus we worship is the **biblical Jesus**—the Son of God, born of a virgin, crucified, risen again, and exalted above all.

- **Acts 4:12** – _“There is no other name…”_
- **Philippians 2:9–11** – _“At the name of Jesus every_
