## GIFT SCRIPTURE STUDIES
**November 19, 2025 / 7:30-9:00 PM**

**Scripture Ref: John 14:12-15 (KJV)**

> "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater [works] than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. 13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do [it]. 15 If ye love me, keep my commandments."

## Living in the Last Days

From the standpoint of salvation history, we are living in the last days. According to Scripture these are times of great falling away but also great revival. In this crucial hour we need to claim the promise of greater victory. Shortly before Jesus died, arose, and ascended to Heaven, He revealed to His disciples who He really was. He declared that He was the visible incarnation of the invisible Father. To see Him was to see the Father manifested in the flesh. If they had difficulty believing His words, they could observe His actions and see that He did works only God could do. By His actions they would know that the Father truly dwelt in Him. (John 14:7-10)

## The Promise of Greater Works

Then He promised, "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father" (John 14:12). At first, this promise seems to be impossible. How could His disciples, whether in the first century or the twenty-first century, perform greater works than God manifested in the flesh? Jesus has redeemed us from sin; how could we do anything equal, not to mention greater?

### Understanding "Greater"

Jesus didn't mean we would perform works greater in quality, value, or power. Rather, we would perform works greater in quantity. Moreover, we can't save anyone, but we can administer the gospel of salvation. The power comes from Jesus, not from ourselves, as we believe on Him. In subsequent verses Jesus explained that we would be able to do these greater works as we pray in His name. When we invoke the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in faith, we express our trust in Him and rely on His atoning sacrifice.

## Jesus Within Us Through the Spirit

In the next few verses Jesus further explained that the relationship with His disciples would soon change. He would depart from them physically but would return invisibly as the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, to dwell in their lives spiritually. He would no longer be "with" them, but He would be "in" them. As such, He would continue to do the work of the Kingdom through them.

While on earth, Jesus subjected Himself to the limits of space and time. He ministered to those who came to Him, and His ministry was confined primarily to His Jewish homeland. By ascending to Heaven and pouring out His Spirit, however, He provided a way for healing, deliverance, and salvation to extend across the entire world and across many generations until His second coming. The inspired writer Luke recorded in his Gospel all that Jesus "began both to do and teach" while on earth (Acts 1:1). In his sequel, the Book of Acts, Luke recorded what Jesus continued to do through believers in the first century. Similarly, we continue the Lord's work of preaching, teaching, healing, and bringing salvation to people in the twenty-first century.

## Last Days: Falling Away and Revival

Paul warned that in the latter days some would depart from the faith and many would reject sound doctrine (I Timothy 4:1; II Timothy 4:3). Yet Peter echoed the prophecy of Joel that in the last days God would pour out His Spirit on all flesh (Acts 2:17). We are seeing the fulfillment of both statements. While some are falling away from truth, many others are coming into truth. We can be part of great backsliding or great revival. The choice is ours.

## Evidence of End-Time Revival

We desire to be part of great end-time revival, and indeed we are seeing it come to pass. More people are turning to Jesus Christ than ever before in human history. More people today have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and have received the gift of the Holy Ghost than ever before. Our fellowship has grown greater than ever before in finances, churches, ministers, and worldwide constituents.

### Modern Day Pentecost

In several national conferences, we have seen more people receive the Holy Ghost in one place than on the original Day of Pentecost in Acts 2. On November 29, 2015, in one day 3,842 people received the Holy Ghost in El Salvador. In February 2016 in national conferences, 3,500 received the Spirit in Bangladesh, while 5,000 received the Spirit in the Philippines.

## Greater Than the Enemy

Yes, it seems that the world is promoting and glorifying sin as never before. But where sin abounds, the grace of God does much more abound (Romans 5:20). Yes, it seems that the devil is fighting harder than ever before as he sees the end approaching. But the Bible assures us: "You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world" (I John 4:4).

## Claiming the Promise

We can indeed do greater works. We have the opportunity to see more people healed, delivered, and saved than any generation before us. It is time for us to claim the promise and act in faith. We will indeed see greater revival and greater victory as we move forward in the will of God.
