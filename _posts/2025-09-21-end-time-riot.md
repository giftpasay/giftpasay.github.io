## The World Turned Upside Down

> *"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures, Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ."* — **Acts 17:1-3**

**Paul's ministry was so powerful and transformative that his enemies declared:** *"These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also"* (Acts 17:6).

**This is the kind of impact the church should have in every generation** - turning the world upside down for the cause of Christ!

## It's High Time to Wake Up

> *"And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light."* — **Romans 13:11-12**

**The time for the church to rise up is now. It's time for the world to be turned upside down for the cause of Christ!**

**The scripture reveals and assures us of a time coming when great changes will take effect.** It will surely be a great struggle to serve the Lord and minister His Word naturally. **As thus, we members of the church, the mystical body of the Lord Jesus, must fight and be triumphant.**

## Our Spiritual Warfare

> *"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds; Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ."* — **2 Corinthians 10:3-5**

**We are in a spiritual battle, but our weapons are not of this world.** They are mighty through God for:
- **Pulling down strongholds**
- **Casting down imaginations**  
- **Bringing every thought into captivity to Christ**
- **Taking revenge against disobedience**

## The Times We're Living In

**As members of the church in these times, "What shall we say? What can we do today?"**

> *"Do you not know that the saints (God's people) will one day judge the world? If the world is to be judged by you, are you not competent to try trivial cases?"* — **1 Corinthians 6:2 AMP**

**We must remember our authority and responsibility as believers.** We are called to be salt and light in a dark world.

### Submission to Authority
> *"Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist have been put in place by God. Therefore whoever resists governmental authority resists the ordinance of God."* — **Romans 13:1-2 AMP**

**While we submit to governing authorities, we must also recognize when the times call for spiritual uprising through revival and renewal.**

## I. Perilous Times Have Come

**The Bible identifies these times we are living in today as perilous, terrible, difficult, times of stress, and grievous** (2 Timothy 3:1).

> *"But understand this, that in the last days will come perilous times of great stress and trouble hard to deal with and hard to bear. For people will be lovers of self and utterly self-centered, lovers of money and aroused by an inordinate greedy desire for wealth, proud and arrogant and contemptuous boasters."* — **2 Timothy 3:1-2 AMP**

### Characteristics of the Last Days
**According to 2 Timothy 3:1-5, people will be:**
- **Lovers of themselves** and utterly self-centered
- **Lovers of money** with greedy desire for wealth  
- **Proud, arrogant, and boastful**
- **Disobedient to parents**, ungrateful, unholy
- **Without natural affection**, callous and inhuman
- **Slanderers and false accusers**
- **Lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God**
- **Having a form of godliness but denying its power**

**These are the times when the world is compelled to comply with certain mandates, protocols, and procedures even beyond our understanding and acceptance.** We are forced to accept realities and facts that are wrongly presented by media and those who don't even know what they stand for.

## II. It's Time to Rise for a R.I.O.T.!

**When we read the headlines, it's not hard to see that our world is on a downward slide.** Political tensions, natural disasters, and disease outbreaks are escalating. More professed believers seem to be falling away from the faith.

**While the world defines riot as violent public disorder, the Church defines RIOT as Revival In Our Times!**

### Traditional Definition of RIOT
**According to Webster's Dictionary:**
- **Noun:** A violent public disorder; a tumultuous disturbance of public peace by a crowd assembled together and acting with common intent
- **Verb:** To take part in disorderly public outbreak; to live in a loose or wanton manner

### The Church's Definition of R.I.O.T.
**But the Church defines RIOT now as Revival In Our Times!**

**It's time for a R.I.O.T.! Let the redeemed rise up; the blood-bought, Holy Spirit-filled, Apostolic Pentecostal Church rise for a riot!**

**Rise up for a riot:**
- **Inside and outside the church**
- **In your homes and families**
- **In your communities**

### In Our Times
> *"And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light."* — **Romans 13:11-12**

**We are living in the times when:**
- **Our salvation is nearer than when we first believed**
- **The night is far spent and the day is at hand**
- **We must cast off works of darkness**
- **We must put on the armor of light**

## What Should We Do?

> *"Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy."* — **Psalm 107:2**

**The Psalmist says we have a responsibility to say so** - to give witness to that redemption - to let others know that God has done something good in our lives.

**"Because I am redeemed, the Holy Ghost is upon me. I am reconciled to God and there is continual cleansing of my sin. I am sanctified, I am perfected, and God does not remember my sins! Because of the redemptive blood, I have victory over the enemy, and I am protected."**

### Nine Essential Actions for End Time Saints

#### 1. LOOK UP
> *"And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh."* — **Luke 21:28**

**When you see prophetic events unfolding, don't look down in despair - look up in expectation!**

#### 2. LET GOD BE GOD
> *"Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him. As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice."* — **Psalm 68:1-3**

**Stop trying to control everything and let God demonstrate His power and authority.**

#### 3. BE STRONG IN THE LORD
> *"Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you."* — **Isaiah 35:4**

> *"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."* — **Ephesians 6:10-11**

**Don't rely on your own strength - be strong in the Lord and His mighty power.**

#### 4. UNITE, BE HUMBLE, PRAY, SEEK HIS FACE, TURN FROM WICKED WAYS
> *"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."* — **2 Chronicles 7:14**

**This is God's formula for national and personal healing:**
- **Humble ourselves**
- **Pray earnestly**  
- **Seek God's face**
- **Turn from wickedness**

#### 5. REJOICE IN THE LORD
> *"Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand."* — **Philippians 4:4-5**

**Maintain joy and peace because the Lord is near.**

#### 6. THINK POSITIVELY
> *"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things."* — **Philippians 4:8**

**Control your thought life by focusing on what is good, pure, and praiseworthy.**

#### 7. BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT
> *"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord."* — **Luke 4:18-19**

**Walk in the fullness and power of the Holy Spirit for effective ministry.**

#### 8. WORSHIP GOD IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH
> *"A time will come, however, indeed it is already here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father is seeking just such people as these as His worshipers. God is a Spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth."* — **John 4:23-24**

**Engage in authentic, Spirit-led worship that honors God.**

#### 9. BE REVIVED
> *"For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones."* — **Isaiah 57:15**

> *"Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee? Show us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation."* — **Psalm 85:6-7**

**Cry out for personal and corporate revival:**

*"Revive us oh Lord, Let Your spirit move inside this temple.*  
*Revive us oh Lord, Let the rivers flow Into our hearts"*

## Walking in Victory

> *"But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."* — **1 Corinthians 15:57-58**

### Walk in the Spirit
> *"This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh... If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."* — **Galatians 5:16-17, 25**

### Put On the Full Armor
> *"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."* — **Ephesians 6:10-11**

**The full armor includes:**
- **Belt of truth** around your waist
- **Breastplate of righteousness**
- **Feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace**
- **Shield of faith** to quench fiery darts
- **Helmet of salvation**
- **Sword of the Spirit**, which is the Word of God
- **Praying always** with all prayer and supplication
