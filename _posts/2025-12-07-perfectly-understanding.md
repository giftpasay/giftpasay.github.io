## Proposition

Beloved brethren, we have entered a season of commemoration. This is a call to remember the day when God gave His only begotten Son for the salvation of mankind (John 3:16).

Because He gave, we are saved.

God’s gift is beyond measure. To unwrap and understand this gift is a privilege given to every child of God. We are living in perilous times, yet grace-abounding times. In this season, let us rejoice and be glad, for unto us a gift has been given that is beyond comparison.

Let us not forget, and let us seek to understand.

### Understanding Seasons

A **season** is a time marked by a particular condition, circumstance, or purpose. It can be a suitable or natural time, or an extended period marked by specific characteristics.

There are four natural seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. These seasons change because of the earth’s movement around the sun.

In the Philippines, we experience:
- A dry season from November to April  
- A rainy season from May to October  

In some areas, there are three seasons:
- Rainy season: May to November  
- Cool dry season: December to February  
- Hot dry season: March to May  

### Spiritual Seasons

Spiritually, God uses seasons to shape us, refine us, and form us into who He intends us to be. Each season influences our faith and walk with God.

God uses seasons to remind us that He makes everything beautiful in its time (Ecclesiastes 3:11). Every season, whether pleasant or difficult, serves a divine purpose.

> “To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.”  
Ecclesiastes 3:1 (KJV)

---

### A Season of Thanksgiving

> “O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.”  
Psalm 136:1-4 (KJV)

> “In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.”  
1 Thessalonians 5:18 (KJV)

---

### The Reason for the Current Season

> “For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.”  
Luke 2:10-14 (KJV)

> “For unto us a child is born… and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.”  
Isaiah 9:6-7 (KJV)

### The Real Reason for the Season  
### Because of Souls’ Salvation (BOSS)

**Scriptures:**  
Matthew 9:35-38  
Acts 1:8  
Romans 1:16 (KJV)

God created man as His masterpiece. Man is precious because of the soul, not the body. The soul gives value to human life.

> “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?”  
Mark 8:36-37 (KJV)

> “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise… not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.”  
2 Peter 3:9 (KJV)

Because of souls’ salvation.

---

## Spiritual Seasons

### 1. Salvation

> “That repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations.”  
Luke 24:46-49 (KJV)

> “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.”  
Acts 2:37-39 (KJV)

Salvation is the foundation. It is God’s invitation to redemption and new life.

---

### 2. Sanctification (Pagpapakabanal)

To sanctify means to set apart for God’s special purpose. God’s people are sanctified because they belong to Him.

> “Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy; for I am the LORD your God.”

Sanctification is both positional and practical. Positional sanctification sets us apart for God. Practical sanctification is a lifelong process of growing in righteous living through dependence on the Holy Spirit.

---

## Conclusion

> “Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.”  
1 Chronicles 16:8-12 (KJV)

> “God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.”  
2 Thessalonians 2:13-17 (KJV)

> “Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith… abounding therein with thanksgiving.”  
Colossians 2:6-10 (KJV)

Let us remain thankful, steadfast, and grounded in Christ as we understand the times and seasons God has placed us in.

## Communion Service

### Holy Communion Text

**Luke 22:14-20 (KJV)**  
Jesus instituted the Lord’s Supper as a memorial of His sacrifice.

**1 Corinthians 11:23-30 (KJV)**  
Paul reminds the church to partake in communion with reverence, self-examination, and discernment of the Lord’s body.

There are two kinds of sanctification:
- **Positional sanctification**: being set apart for God  
- **Practical sanctification**: a progressive growth in righteous living through reliance on the Holy Spirit

May we partake with gratitude, understanding, and reverence, remembering the gift given for our salvation.
