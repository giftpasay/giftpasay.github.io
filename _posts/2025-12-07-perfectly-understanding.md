### Seasons — What are they?

**SEASONS** — a time characterized by a particular circumstance or feature; a suitable or natural time or occasion; an indefinite period of time; a period of the year characterized by or associated with a particular activity or phenomenon.

* The four seasons are called spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Seasons change throughout the year because of the way the earth moves. The earth orbits, or revolves around, the sun.

* What are the four seasons in the Philippines? Our Country has two main seasons characterized by rainfall — a **Dry Season from November to April** and a **Rainy Season from May to October.** However, in some areas there are three seasons: a rainy season from May to November, a cool dry season from December to February, and a hot dry season from March to May.

In the Spiritual aspect — What does it mean? The Lord created different seasons in our lives to shape us, help us deal, and create us into who He intended us to be.

He uses seasons to show us that He is good and can “make everything beautiful for its own time” A spiritual season is a set of circumstances that influence our faith and our walk with God and provide specific and necessary conditions to help us mature and live fruitful lives for Christ.

### What do the seasons represent biblically?

Each season has a significant purpose in our life, as God designs (Ecclesiastes 3:1-11). God ordained these seasons to mould us into who he intends us to be. They can be good or bad experiences, but they are there to remind us that God makes everything beautiful in its own time (Ecclesiastes 3:11).

### THE REAL REASON FOR THE SEASON…
**BECAUSE OF SOUL’S SALVATION** (BOSS)

📖 Matthew 9:35-38 / Acts 1:8 / Romans 1:16 (KJV)

God created man as His masterpiece. Man is the most important and precious among His creations. He created him in His own image (Gen. 1:26-27). The Soul is what makes man valuable and precious, not his body.

But the scripture said;

- [x] **For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?** 
  Sapagka't ano ang mapapakinabang ng tao, na makamtan ang buong sanglibutan, at mapapahamak ang kaniyang buhay?
   
- [x] **Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?**  
  Sapagka't anong ibibigay ng tao na katumbas sa kaniyang buhay  
  — Mark 8:36-37

- [x] **2 Peter 3:9** The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.  
  Hindi mapagpaliban ang Panginoon tungkol sa kaniyang pangako, na gaya ng pagpapalibang ipinalalagay ng iba; kundi mapagpahinuhod sa inyo, na hindi niya ibig na sinoman ay mapahamak, kundi ang lahat ay magsipagsisi.

**“BECAUSE OF SOULS SALVATION”**

## Spiritual Seasons

## 1. SALVATION

> “Thus it is written… that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations…”  
— Luke 24:46-49 (KJV)

> “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost…”  
— Acts 2:37-39 (KJV)

---

## 2. SANCTIFICATION — (PAGPAPAKA BANAL)

In its most basic sense, to sanctify something is to set it apart for God's special use and purpose. Therefore God's people are sometimes said to be sanctified because they are set apart for God's special purposes in the world:

> “Consecrate yourselves, therefore, and be holy; for I am the LORD your God.”

## Conclusion

> “Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people…  
Seek the LORD and his strength… Remember his marvellous works…”  
— 1 Chronicles 16:8-12 (KJV)

> “God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth…  
Therefore, brethren, stand fast…”  
— 2 Thessalonians 2:13-17

> “Rooted and built up in him… abounding therein with thanksgiving…  
For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily…”  
— Colossians 2:6-10 (KJV)

### Holy Communion Text

📖 **Luke 22:14-20 (KJV)**

“And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.  
15 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:  
16 For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.  
17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:  
18 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.  
19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.  
20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.”

📖 **1 Corinthians 11:23-30 (KJV)**

"For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:  
24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.  
25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.  
26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.

27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.  
28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.  
29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.  
30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep."

There are two kinds of sanctification: first, positional sanctification means set apart for God and in some instances set apart for God’s purpose; second, practical sanctification is a progressive process and means growing in righteous living. This is dependent on a person’s reliance on the Holy Spirit.
