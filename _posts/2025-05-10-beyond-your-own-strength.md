Sometimes, life gets hard. We try to be strong using our own power. We think about what we're good at and what we've done before. But sometimes, that's not enough. We feel like we can't do it anymore.

The Bible talks about this too. It says that our own strength is not always enough, but God can give us strength. Think about the Apostle Paul. He was a strong person, but he had a hard problem. He asked God to take it away, but God said, "My grace is enough for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness" (2 Corinthians 12:9). This means when we are weak, God's power can be really strong in us.

It's like the small seed we talked about. Its strength to grow doesn't just come from itself. God made it to grow. In the same way, our strength can come from God when we feel weak.

Think about times in the Bible when people felt like they couldn't go on. Moses felt like he couldn't lead the people, but God helped him. David was just a young shepherd, but God gave him the strength to fight a giant. Jesus felt very weak before he was crucified, but God's power helped him through it.

So, when you feel like you don't have enough strength, remember what the Bible says. God's strength can help you, even when you feel like you have none. It's not about being strong by yourself. It's about trusting that God can give you the strength you need, even when things are hard.

Just like the seed trusts God to help it grow, we can trust God to give us strength beyond what we have on our own.
When we feel weak, we can ask God for help. He is always there to give us strength and help us grow. So, don't worry if you feel weak sometimes. Just remember that God's power is always with you, and He can help you do amazing things, even when you think you can't.
