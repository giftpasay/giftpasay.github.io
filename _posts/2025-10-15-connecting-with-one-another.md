## CONNECTING WITH ONE ANOTHER
### SECOND SECTION: THE APOSTOLIC CHURCH IN A POSTMODERN WORLD
*(Positions the Apostolic movement in contrast to other historical and contemporary Christian movements. Identifies the essential elements of an Apostolic worldview.)*

---

## FOREWORD
The main theme of this book by author David Bernard (UPCI General Superintendent) is how Apostolic Pentecostals should live and how the Apostolic Pentecostal church should minister in a diverse, postmodern world.

## SCRIPTURE TEXT
> “And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.  
> And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.”  
> — Acts 2:42–43

## THE CHALLENGE OF TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY CULTURE
In twenty-first-century culture, there is less respect for authority, less loyalty to tradition, and less trust in institutions.  
This attitude can be positive if it motivates people to move beyond unbiblical or unproductive methods of operation; however, it can also be negative if it leads to or reflects a shallow dedication or commitment to the work of God’s kingdom.  

We need to make a strong case for individuals to be committed to the local church and for churches and ministers to be committed to an organized fellowship of ministers and churches such as the UPCI/UPCPI.

## THE PURPOSE OF UNITED ORGANIZATION
At the beginning of the UPCI General Constitution, it states:  
> “The purpose of the United Pentecostal Church International is to carry the whole gospel to the whole world by the whole church.”  

As Christians, we have a personal responsibility to fulfill the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19–20, where the Lord commanded us to evangelize and make disciples of all nations.  
This task cannot be accomplished by one person or one church alone; therefore, we must work together in unity.  

We must unite with others of “like precious faith” (2 Peter 1:1).  

The UPCPI is not the only possible organization, nor are we perfect.  
However, we need an effective structure like this to promote Apostolic missions worldwide, establish Apostolic churches, train Apostolic ministers, produce Apostolic publications, provide Apostolic education, and develop Apostolic resources for ministries such as children, youth, women, and men.

We need an organized structure through which we can fulfill the Great Commission while implementing scriptural qualifications for ministers and following scriptural instructions to work under proper spiritual authority and accountability.

## THE IMPORTANCE OF ORGANIZATION
Those who work independently are not nearly as effective.  
They still need some form of association to develop an informal network, although such a structure may be vague and undefined.  

It is better to have an organization with clear leadership, qualifications, guidelines, policies, and procedures; where the members have input and there is the ability to make changes even at the organizational level.  

For an organization to be truly effective, it must consistently follow its own policies and procedures, operate transparently, remain open to the influence of its members, and respond to changing circumstances and needs.

---

## COMBINED RESOURCES AND GREATER IMPACT
Although bureaucracy, red tape, and human error are unavoidable in any human organization, our combined resources can achieve far more and have a longer-lasting impact than working independently.  

For example, many well-intentioned believers have spent large amounts of money on mission endeavors that resulted in little or no benefit for the work of God because of unproven doctrinal integrity, poor management, or lack of long-term accountability for the recipients.  

By working together, we can ensure greater effectiveness, accountability, and sustainability in advancing the mission.

---

## BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES FOR ORGANIZATION
We are part of an Apostolic organization to follow biblical principles of unity, accountability, and submission to spiritual authority.  
(See Acts 15:1–32; 1 Corinthians 12:12–28; 1 Thessalonians 5:11–14; Titus 1:5–9; Hebrews 13:7, 17.)  

It is noteworthy that the New Testament saints believed in and participated in organization beyond their local churches.  

> “As they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep, which were determined by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem.  
> So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.”  
> — Acts 16:4–5  

Although the New Testament does not give a detailed structure of an organization, it clearly teaches the importance of principles for church government, ministerial qualifications, oversight, and cooperative work.  

Therefore, we should have a system that enables us to implement these spiritual requirements.  
Even ministers are not exempt from the principles they teach to church members.  
We all need fellowship, accountability, and the leadership that an organization provides.

---

## THE VALUE OF DIVERSITY
The diversity within a large organization is also beneficial.  
If we restricted our fellowship only to those who think exactly like we do, we would lose balance and valuable perspective.  
If we submitted only to leaders we personally prefer, we would not truly practice biblical principles of instruction, correction, and submission.  

The variety of gifts, talents, and ministries represented in our organization helps our ministers and churches become more well-rounded and mature.

---

## UNITY OF THE SPIRIT AND FAITH
By participating in fellowship, we are “endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” as we grow toward maturity “till we all come to the unity of the faith” (Ephesians 4:3, 13).

> “Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace...  
> Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.”  
> — Ephesians 4:3, 13  

In the second paragraph of the Fundamental Doctrine of the UPC, it states:  
> “We shall endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit until we all come into the unity of the faith.”
