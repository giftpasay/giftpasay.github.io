## The Power of Tenacious Persistence

**TENACIOUS** means **persistent in maintaining, adhering to, or seeking something valued or desired.** It represents unwavering determination and the quality displayed by someone who just won't quit - who keeps trying until they reach their goal.

**TENACITY** is **persistent determination** - the quality or fact of being able to grip something firmly, the quality or state of being persistent, and the ability to hold on to something with unwavering focus.

> *"To succeed in life in today's world, you must have the will and tenacity to finish the job."* — **Chin-Ning-Chu**

> *"Maintain that motivation to go from A to B and to keep your focus on that target without any weakening. That is called tenacity; stamina in your motivation."* — **Arsene Wenger**

## The Journey of Traversing Back to Basics

**TRAVERSE** means **to travel across or through, to move back and forth or sideways.** It represents our spiritual journey of crossing over from where we are to where God wants us to be.

> *"The only way you can stay on top is to remember to touch bottom and get back to basics."* — **Shane Black**

**BACK TO BASICS** means **to return to a simpler way of doing something or thinking about something.** We have to be the change we wish to see in others. If we want to live a simpler, happier life, we need to go back to basics and rekindle the values of empathy, tolerance, compassion, trust, and love in ourselves.

### The Foundation Scriptures
- **Deuteronomy 6:1-5** - Love the Lord with all your heart
- **Joshua 1:8-9** - Meditate on God's Word day and night
- **Ephesians 4:1-7** - Walk worthy of your calling
- **Revelation 2:1-5** - Return to your first love

## Understanding Breakthrough

**BREAKTHROUGH** is defined as:
- **A sudden advance** especially in knowledge or technique
- **A person's first notable success**
- **An act or instance of moving through or beyond an obstacle**
- **An instance of passing through a barrier or protection**
- **In warfare:** an offensive military assault that penetrates and carries beyond a defensive line

> *"Instead of me having a breakdown, I'm focusing on me having a breakthrough."* — **Terrell Owens**

**We experience breakthroughs even in the valleys** - those difficult seasons of life become the very places where God demonstrates His power and faithfulness.

## The Five Basic Functions of Christian Life

### 1. Worship - Growing in Relationship with God
**To grow in relationship to God through worship** - magnifying His name and acknowledging His supremacy in our lives.

### 2. Fellowship - Growing in Relationship with Each Other
**To grow in relationship to each other** through fellowship and community, building meaningful connections within the body of Christ.

### 3. Missions - Reaching Out to Others
**To reach out to others outside of our group and church** and make a difference in people's lives in Jesus' name through missions and outreach.

### 4. Discipleship - Growing Members to Leadership
**To grow members to leadership readiness** and multiply new groups through intentional discipleship and spiritual development.

### 5. Evangelism - Sharing Christ's Love
**To intentionally share the love of Christ** with our Friends, Relatives, Associates, and Neighbors through personal evangelism.

## Understanding Our Purpose for the Miraculous

### The Great Commandment
> *"Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."* — **Matthew 22:36-40**

### The Great Commission
> *"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen."* — **Matthew 28:19-20**

## The Five Pillars of Church Purpose

### ✓ Worship - Matthew 22:37 (Magnification)
**Love God with all your heart, soul, and mind** - This is about magnifying God's name and giving Him the worship He deserves.

### ✓ Fellowship - Matthew 28:19 (Membership)
**Baptizing them** - This represents membership and fellowship within the body of Christ, creating meaningful community.

### ✓ Discipleship - Matthew 28:20 (Maturity)
**Teaching them to observe all things** - This is about spiritual maturity and growing disciples who can lead others.

### ✓ Service - Matthew 22:39 (Ministry)
**Love your neighbor as yourself** - This encompasses ministry and serving others as an expression of Christ's love.

### ✓ Outreach - Matthew 28:19 (Multiplication)
**Go ye therefore** - This is about multiplication through evangelism and reaching the lost with the Gospel.

## The Call to Tenacious Faith

> *"Do not give up your dream because it is apparently not being realized, because you cannot see it coming true. Cling to your vision with all the tenacity you can muster. Keep it bright; do not let the bread-and-butter side of life cloud your ideal or dim it."* — **Orison Swett Marden**

**In our spiritual walk, we must demonstrate the same tenacity.** We cannot allow the mundane concerns of daily life to cloud our spiritual vision or dim our passion for God's kingdom.

**Tenaciously traversing back to basics** means:
- **Holding firmly** to fundamental Christian principles
- **Persistently pursuing** spiritual growth and maturity
- **Consistently practicing** the basic functions of Christian life
- **Courageously crossing over** barriers that hinder our spiritual progress

## The Promise of Divine Breakthroughs

**When we tenaciously return to the basics of our faith**, we position ourselves for divine breakthroughs. These breakthroughs come not because we've mastered complex spiritual techniques, but because we've remained faithful to the fundamental principles of Christian living.

**God honors tenacity.** He responds to persistent faith, unwavering devotion, and consistent obedience to His basic commands. **The breakthroughs we seek are often found not in pursuing the spectacular, but in faithfully executing the fundamentals.**

## A Call to Tenacious Faithfulness

**In this season of unfolding God's abounding blessing**, we are called to tenaciously traverse back to the basics of our faith. **This is not about regression but about strengthening our foundation** for the greater things God wants to do in and through us.

**Let us commit to tenacious faith** - holding fast to worship, fellowship, discipleship, service, and outreach with unwavering determination. **Let us traverse back to these basics** not as a retreat, but as a strategic advance that positions us for divine breakthroughs.

**The power of tenacious traversing** lies not in our ability to do great things, but in our willingness to faithfully do the basic things that God has called us to do. **In this faithfulness, we will experience the divine breakthroughs** that come from a life aligned with God's fundamental purposes.

> *"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."* — **Galatians 6:9**

**Tenaciously traverse back to basics, and watch God unfold His abounding blessings through divine breakthroughs in your life!**
