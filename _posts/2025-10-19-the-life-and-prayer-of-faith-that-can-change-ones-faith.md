## The Power of a Good Name

> *"A good name (earned by honorable behavior, godly wisdom, moral courage, and personal integrity) is more desirable than great riches; And favor is better than silver and gold."* — **Proverbs 22:1 AMP**

**The Bible is filled with stories of change.** The Lord delights to change men and women's lives by a simple touch. In this message, we'll explore a kind of life and of faith that triumphed over fate.

**A man. His name. The meaning behind his prayer. And the spiritual lessons we can learn from his life.** Let's dive into the full story and uncover its wholesome truths.

**Understand that faith can change your fate!**

## The Legacy of Jabez

**A Google search of the name "Jabez" on the Internet yields some interesting information.** For example, the Guangzhou Liby Enterprise Group Co., Ltd. established in south China in 1994 boasts annual sales in excess of $375 million. According to their website, one of their product lines is known as **"Dr. Jabez"** - featuring various cleaning products.

**This name is somewhat associated with success!**

### Historical Significance

**Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible explains:** "The Jews say that he [Jabez] was a famous doctor of the law and left many disciples behind him. And it should seem, by mentioning of his name so abruptly here, his name was well known when Ezra wrote this."

**Robert Jamieson (1802-1880) states in his commentary:** "The Jewish writers affirm that he was an eminent doctor in the law, whose reputation drew so many scribes around him that a town was called by his name." (1 Chronicles 2:55)

**Despite being mentioned in only three verses, Jabez's life of faith has inspired books, articles, discussions, and countless believers throughout history!**

## Understanding Faith and Fate

### Faith Defined

> *"Now faith is the assurance (title deed, confirmation) of things hoped for (divinely guaranteed), and the evidence of things not seen [the conviction of their reality—faith comprehends as fact what cannot be experienced by the physical senses]."* — **Hebrews 11:1 AMP**

**Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.**

### Fate Defined

**FATE:** The will or principle or determining cause by which things in general are believed to come to be as they are or events to happen as they do; an inevitable and often adverse outcome, condition, or end; final outcome; the expected result of normal development; destiny; kapalaran (Tagalog).

**The question is: Can faith change fate?** The life of Jabez answers with a resounding YES!

## Who Was Jabez in the Bible?

### A Name Marked by Pain and Sorrow

> *"And Jabez was more honourable than his brethren: and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with sorrow."* — **1 Chronicles 4:9**

**Jabez was introduced in the book of Chronicles where we learn:**
- **He was more honorable than all his brethren**
- **His name means "pain" or "sorrow"**
- **His mother gave him this name** because of the sorrow she experienced during childbirth

**In biblical times, names often carried deep significance.** For Jabez, his name symbolized hardship and suffering from the very beginning.

### Refusing to Accept His Name as His Destiny

**Despite this painful beginning, as he grew up, Jabez refused to let his name define his fate or his destiny.** Instead of accepting a life of pain or sorrow, he turned to God in prayer.

**This teaches us a crucial lesson:** No matter what labels or circumstances we are born into, we can rise above them through faith and determination.

### A New Life, Not a New Name

**There is no record that God changed Jabez's name despite its negative meaning.** Jabez was not given a new name like Abram became Abraham or Jacob became Israel.

**His new life changed the meaning of the name in his life!** A new life in Christ Jesus and an encounter with God can give someone's name new meaning.

**Interestingly, a place where many families of the scribes lived was also called Jabez** (1 Chronicles 2:55) - named after this honorable man!

## The Story of Jabez in Context

**The story of Jabez in the Bible is found in 1 Chronicles 4:9-10, nestled within a long genealogy of the tribe of Judah.** While most of the chapter lists names and lineages, Jabez's story stands out because of his prayer and God's response to it.

**These two verses may seem small, but they carry a powerful message about:**
- **Faith** in difficult circumstances
- **Prayer** that moves God's heart
- **God's willingness** to bless those who seek Him

## The Prayer of Jabez

> *"And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested."* — **1 Chronicles 4:10**

**Let's break down this powerful prayer to understand its deeper meaning.**

### The Four P's in the Prayer of Jabez

#### 1. PROVISIONS / PROSPERITY
**"Bless me indeed"**

**Jabez boldly asked for God's best blessings, not settling for anything less.** This shows us that it's okay to ask God for abundant blessings when we approach Him with humility and faith.

**Key insights:**
- He didn't pray a timid, uncertain prayer
- He asked for genuine, substantial blessing
- He believed God could and would bless him

#### 2. PURPOSE
**"Enlarge my coast / territory"**

**This was a request for greater influence, responsibility, and purpose—not just physical land.** Jabez wanted to make a bigger impact for God's glory.

**Key insights:**
- He had vision beyond his current situation
- He wanted more opportunities to serve
- He sought expansion for God's purposes, not selfish ambition

#### 3. PRESENCE
**"That Your hand would be with me"**

**Jabez acknowledged his dependence on God's presence and guidance.** He knew that without God's help, his efforts would be in vain.

**Key insights:**
- Blessings without God's presence are meaningless
- Success requires divine guidance
- God's hand represents His power, protection, and favor

#### 4. PROTECTION
**"Keep me from evil that it may not grieve me"**

**He sought protection from sin and harm, both from external forces and his own actions.** Jabez wanted to break free from the curse of his name and live a life that brought joy, not sorrow.

**Key insights:**
- He recognized the danger of evil
- He wanted to avoid bringing grief to himself or others
- He sought to live above his name's negative meaning

### The Result: God Granted His Request

**"And God granted him that which he requested."**

**This shows us that God honors bold, faith-filled prayers!** When we pray according to His will with genuine faith, God delights to answer.

## Lessons from the Story of Jabez

**The Jabez Bible story teaches us several key lessons that are still relevant today:**

### 1. Your Past Does Not Define Your Real Person

**Jabez's name symbolized pain, but he didn't let that dictate his future.** Similarly, our past mistakes, labels, or circumstances don't have to limit us. **With God, we can rewrite our story.**

**Your beginning doesn't determine your ending when God is involved!**

### 2. Bold Prayers Bring Positive Results

**Jabez didn't pray little, timid prayers. He asked for big blessings, and God answered.** This reminds us to approach God with confidence, knowing that He delights in answering the prayers of those who trust Him.

> *"Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us."* — **Ephesians 3:20**

### 3. Persistent and Faithful Prayer Matters

**Though the Bible records Jabez's prayer briefly, it's likely that he prayed consistently and fervently.**

> *"The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much."* — **James 5:16**

**Breakthroughs often come through persistent and faithful prayers.**

### 4. God's Presence Is Essential

**Jabez understood that blessings without God's presence are meaningless.** Like Moses in Exodus 33:15, he sought God's hand to guide and empower him.

**Material blessings alone lead to emptiness.** God's presence makes all the difference.

### 5. Faith Over Fate

**Jabez's full story teaches us that our circumstances don't have to define our fate.** No matter how difficult your situation, God can transform your story when you trust Him.

**Faith is more powerful than fate. Prayer is more powerful than circumstance.**

## Spiritual Courage from the Life of Jabez

**The story of Jabez in the Bible is a testament to spiritual courage.** Despite his painful beginnings, he chose to trust God and pray boldly.

**His life reminds us that:**

### Faith Can Overcome Fate
**No matter how difficult your circumstances, God can transform your story.** You are not bound by your past, your name, your family history, or your current situation.

### Prayer Is a Powerful Tool
**The prayer of Jabez shows us that God listens to those who seek Him with humility and boldness.** Prayer changes things because it connects us with the God who changes everything.

### God's Blessings Are Limitless
**When we ask for His best, He is able to do "exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think"** (Ephesians 3:20).

Don't limit God with small prayers or small expectations!

## Applying the Story of Jabez to Our Lives

**This message about Jabez is not only about his prayer—it's about how we can live a life of faith and purpose.** Here are practical steps we can follow:

### 1. Ask God to Bless You Indeed
**Don't settle for small blessings.** Trust God for His best. Be specific, be bold, be expectant.

### 2. Expand Your Vision
**Pray for greater opportunities to serve and glorify God.** Ask Him to enlarge your territory—your influence, your ministry, your impact.

### 3. Seek God's Presence Daily
**Prioritize your relationship with Him above all else.** No blessing is worth having without His presence.

### 4. Pray for Protection
**Ask God to guard your heart and keep you from sin.** Pray for protection from evil—both external threats and internal weaknesses.

### 5. Rise Above Your Past
**Like Jabez, choose faith over fear and trust God to rewrite your story.** Your past is not your prison—it's your testimony in the making.

## Biblical Examples of Transformation

**The Bible gives us many examples of people whose lives were transformed by an encounter with God:**

### The Gadarene Demoniac
> *"And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains."* — **Mark 5:1-3**

**From demon-possessed to delivered, from tormented to testimonial!** Jesus changed this man's fate completely.

### Jairus and the Woman with the Issue of Blood
> *"And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet, and besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live... And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years, and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse, when she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment."* — **Mark 5:22-27**

**Two desperate situations, two different approaches, one powerful Savior!** Both received their miracle through faith.

## God's Promise of Blessing

> *"Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth."* — **3 John 1:2**

**God desires to bless you!** He wants you to prosper spiritually, physically, and in every area of life.

> *"For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee."* — **Hebrews 6:13-14**

**When God blesses, He blesses abundantly!** When He multiplies, He multiplies exponentially!
