Receiving the Holy Ghost is one of the greatest experiences a person can have—it is the **indwelling of God’s Spirit**, the fulfillment of God’s promise, and the essential second part of the New Birth. This experience is not reserved for a select few; it is available to **everyone who believes and obeys** the Gospel.

## The Promise is for You

On the Day of Pentecost, Peter preached a powerful message that concluded with this invitation:

> “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” — _Acts 2:38_

He then declared:

> “For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off…” — _Acts 2:39_

This promise is still being fulfilled today!

## Step 1: Repentance

The first step toward receiving the Holy Ghost is **genuine repentance**. This means turning away from sin and surrendering your heart fully to God.

- Acknowledge your sin (Romans 3:23)
- Ask for forgiveness (1 John 1:9)
- Commit to a new direction (Acts 3:19)

Repentance prepares the heart as a **holy vessel** for the Spirit of God to dwell in.

## Step 2: Faith and Expectation

Receiving the Holy Ghost is an act of **faith**. Believe that God desires to fill you:

> “He that cometh to God must believe that he is…” — _Hebrews 11:6_

You don’t need to beg—just **believe, surrender, and expect**. God wants to fill you more than you even want to receive Him.

## Step 3: Worship and Yielding

As you pray, begin to **worship Jesus out loud**—not in your mind, but with your voice. Praise Him for who He is. Thank Him for the promise. Then, as you feel His presence move, **yield your tongue** to the Spirit.

You may begin to speak in a language you do not understand. This is the biblical evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost (Acts 2:4, Acts 10:46, Acts 19:6).

## Common Helps

- Don’t overthink—just **let go** and trust God.
- Surround yourself with believers who can pray with you.
- Remove distractions and focus solely on Jesus.

## What It Feels Like

You may feel joy, peace, or power. You may cry or laugh. The experience is unique for every person—but what is consistent is this: **you will speak in tongues** as the Spirit gives the utterance.

## Conclusion

You can receive the Holy Ghost **today**. You don’t need a perfect background or a special title—just a hungry heart and a surrendered will.

> “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.” — _Matthew 5:6_

If you haven't yet received the Holy Ghost, pray with faith—and **expect the promise**.
