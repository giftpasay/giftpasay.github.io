Baptism is a foundational act of obedience in the Christian life, and how it is performed carries deep theological meaning. For Oneness Pentecostals, **baptism in the name of Jesus Christ** is not merely a tradition, but a **biblical command** and an essential part of the new birth experience. It is directly connected to the remission of sins and the application of the gospel to a person’s life.

## The Apostolic Pattern

The Book of Acts provides a clear and consistent pattern for how the early church baptized new believers. In every recorded instance, baptism was performed **in the name of Jesus**:

- **Acts 2:38** – _“Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins...”_
- **Acts 8:16** – _“…they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.”_
- **Acts 10:48** – _“…he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.”_
- **Acts 19:5** – _“…they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.”_
- **Acts 22:16** – _“Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.”_

This consistent use of Jesus’ name in baptism demonstrates that the apostles understood the importance of invoking **the revealed name of God—Jesus Christ**—as part of the act.

## Theological Significance

Baptism in Jesus’ name is more than symbolic—it is **where the name of Jesus is applied to the life of the believer**, bringing about the remission (or washing away) of sins. The water itself holds no power, but faith in the name of Jesus **activates the spiritual transaction** that baptism represents.

- **Acts 2:38** connects baptism directly to the _remission of sins_.
- **Romans 6:3–4** teaches that in baptism, we are _buried with Christ_ and rise to walk in newness of life.
- **Galatians 3:27** states, _“For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.”_

By being baptized in Jesus’ name, the believer is **identifying with Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection**, and entering into covenant with Him.

## What About Matthew 28:19?

Many Christians are familiar with **Matthew 28:19**, where Jesus instructed His disciples to baptize _“in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”_ Oneness believers do not reject this verse; instead, they understand it **through the lens of apostolic practice**.

The key word in this verse is “name”—**singular**, not plural. The apostles understood that **the name** Jesus refers to Himself as encompasses all three titles:

- **Father** – God in creation.
- **Son** – God in redemption.
- **Holy Ghost** – God in regeneration.

The one saving name that fulfills Matthew 28:19 is **Jesus**. That is why every apostolic baptism recorded in Scripture was done in **Jesus’ name**—it was the correct and full understanding of Christ’s command.

## Is Jesus Name Baptism Required for Salvation?

Oneness Pentecostals affirm that **baptism in Jesus’ name is part of the biblical plan of salvation**. It is not an optional ritual or a secondary act. When Peter preached the first message of the New Testament church in Acts 2, he gave a clear command:

> “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins...” (Acts 2:38)

Jesus Himself declared in **John 3:5**:

> “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”

Water baptism in the name of Jesus is the **“born of water”** component of the new birth.

## Conclusion

Baptism in the name of Jesus is not a modern invention—it is the apostolic, biblical method taught and practiced by the early church. It is how sins are remitted, how the name of Jesus is applied, and how we publicly identify with Christ. More than a tradition, it is an act of **obedience, faith, and spiritual transformation**.
