The incarnation of Jesus Christ is one of the most powerful truths in all of Scripture. Oneness Pentecostals believe that **Jesus is not the second person of a Trinity**, but **the one true God revealed in human form**. He is **God manifest in the flesh**, the visible image of the invisible God, and the full expression of God's nature, character, and purpose.

## The Scriptural Declaration

The apostle Paul makes this bold and clear statement in **1 Timothy 3:16**:

> “And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh…”

This verse leaves no room for ambiguity—**God Himself** came in flesh. He did not send another being or person to do His work of redemption; He came **personally**. The eternal, invisible Spirit took on a visible, human form. This is not a partial representation of God, but the **fullness** of who He is in bodily form.

- **Colossians 2:9** – _“For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.”_
- **John 1:1, 14** – _“The Word was God… And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us…”_
- **Isaiah 9:6** – _“For unto us a child is born… and his name shall be called… The mighty God, The everlasting Father…”_

These scriptures affirm the identity of Jesus as **Jehovah God in human form**.

## Jesus: Not a Second Person, but the One True God

Trinitarian doctrine teaches that Jesus is the second person of a triune godhead. However, the Bible consistently affirms the **oneness of God**:

> “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.” — _Deuteronomy 6:4_

Jesus is not separate from the Father—He is the **Father revealed in flesh**. He is not another being sent by God, but **God come to save**.

- **John 14:9** – _“He that hath seen me hath seen the Father…”_
- **John 10:30** – _“I and my Father are one.”_
- **2 Corinthians 5:19** – _“To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself…”_

These verses do not support a multi-personal deity but clearly point to a **singular God** fully revealed in Jesus Christ.

## The Purpose of the Incarnation

Why did God become flesh? The answer is rooted in love and redemption. God came in flesh:

- To **reveal Himself** fully to humanity.
- To **redeem mankind** by shedding His own blood (Acts 20:28).
- To **fulfill the law** and become the perfect sacrifice.
- To **demonstrate how to live** a holy, obedient life.

Only by becoming a man could God truly pay the price for sin on our behalf. Jesus' death on the cross was **not a substitute from a third party**, but **God Himself laying down His life for His creation**.

## Understanding the Dual Nature of Christ

Jesus was both fully **God** and fully **man**. This is known as the **dual nature** of Christ. As a man, He felt hunger, thirst, pain, and even death. As God, He healed the sick, forgave sins, walked on water, and rose from the grave.

- **As man**, He slept in the boat.
- **As God**, He calmed the storm.
- **As man**, He prayed in the garden.
- **As God**, He raised the dead.

Understanding this dual nature helps us reconcile the humanity we read about in the Gospels with the divine power Jesus demonstrated. He was not a lesser being or junior deity—He was **Emmanuel, God with us** (Matthew 1:23).

## Conclusion

To know Jesus is to know God. He is not one of three divine persons, but the **one true God made visible**. Through Jesus, the invisible God became touchable, approachable, and knowable. The mystery of the incarnation is not meant to confuse us but to **reveal the depth of God's love and the lengths He went to redeem us**.

> “In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.” — _Colossians 2:9_

To worship Jesus is to worship the one God of Scripture. To call upon His name is to invoke the name above every name. Truly, Jesus is **God manifest in the flesh**.
