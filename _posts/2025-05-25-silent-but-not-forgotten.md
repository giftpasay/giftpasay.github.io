# Silent but not forgotten

_Text: Luke 2:36-37_  
_Preacher: Ptr. Dexter Velasco_

---

Pastor Dex delivered a powerful message about enduring through silent seasons in our spiritual journey, using the life of Anna the prophetess as an example of faithfulness during times when God seems quiet.

## The 400 Silent Years

Ptr. Dex began by explaining the "intertestamental period" - the 400 years between the book of Malachi and the book of Matthew. This period is called the "400 silent years" because:

- **No new books of the Bible were written**
- **No recognized prophets spoke with divine authority**
- **No miracles, signs, or wonders were recorded**
- **God was literally silent during this time**

Many Jews believed that God had withdrawn His active presence. Without prophets, they longed for a word from God, creating a spiritual hunger that shaped the culture we see in the New Testament.

## Historical Context of the Silent Years

During these 400 years, significant changes occurred:

**Political Changes:**

- Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire
- Greek culture (Hellenism) was introduced to Israel
- Greek became the common language
- The Old Testament was translated into Greek (Septuagint)

**Religious Development:**

- Antiochus Epiphanes tried to force Greek religion on the Jews
- He set up a statue of Zeus in the temple
- This led to the Maccabean revolt for religious freedom
- Eventually, the Roman Empire conquered under General Pompey
- Herod the Great was installed as king

By the time of Jesus, Israel was under Roman occupation - desolate, joyless, sorrowful, and enslaved.

## Anna: A Woman of Faith in Silent Times

In the midst of this spiritual darkness, there was a woman named Anna who lived a life of faithful prayer and worship:

> _"Anna, a prophet, was also there in the temple. She was the daughter of Penuel from the tribe of Asher, and she was very old. Her husband died when they had been married only seven years. Then she lived as a widow to the age of 84. She never left the temple but stayed there day and night, worshiping God with fasting and prayer."_ — **Luke 2:36-37**

## Anna's Testimony: Overlooked but Not by God

**Anna's Life Characteristics:**

- She was **very old** (84 years)
- She was a **widow for most of her life** (married only 7 years)
- She **never left the temple**
- She worshiped **day and night with fasting and prayer**

In Jewish culture, widowhood was often seen as a symbol of vulnerability and suffering. Anna's life was full of pain, difficulties, and suffering. Yet despite her circumstances, she chose to live in the temple and maintain her devotion to God.

**Key Insight:** Anna is only mentioned three times in the Bible, but her spiritual life was deep and instructive. While kings and priests became corrupt, Anna quietly burned with fire in prayer.

## Lessons from Silent Seasons

Ptr. Dex shared from his personal experience as a church planter, where he faced almost a year without any baptisms or visible fruit. He described:

- Walking alone in the heat, visiting homes for Bible studies
- Questioning whether he was in the right place
- Feeling like giving up after months of apparent failure
- Finally seeing breakthrough when God moved in His timing

**The Reality:** In our service to God, there are seasons when we go through what feels like "silent seasons" - times when:

- God seems to have forgotten us
- Our prayers seem to go unanswered
- We feel discouraged and want to give up
- We wonder if our ministry has any value

## The Power of Persistence in Silent Times

**Anna's Example teaches us:**

1. **Don't abandon your service to God** regardless of pain or circumstances
2. **True service is tested when you're alone** - not just when you're in church
3. **Your pain can either push you away from God or pull you deeper into Him**
4. **Prayer was not just a reaction for Anna - it was routine, lifestyle, and joy**

**Important Truth:** It's easy to serve God when you have community support, but the real test comes when you're alone - at work, at school, in your community. That's where your true devotion to God is proven.

## God's Timing and Faithfulness

Ptr. Dex emphasized that even when God seems silent, He is not absent. Anna's reward came when she met the Messiah - the answer to all her prayers. The Bible says she "gave thanks to God and spoke about the child" when she saw Jesus.

**Personal Testimony:** After months of struggle in church planting, Ptr. Dex discovered that converts from years earlier were already in his area, and God began to move powerfully. What seemed like God's silence was actually God's preparation.

## The Challenge for Today

**For Pastors and Ministers:**

- There are times of loneliness and struggle in ministry
- You may feel forgotten or unnoticed
- But God sees your faithfulness during silent seasons

**For All Believers:**

- Your relationship with God shouldn't depend on circumstances
- When you walk close to God, you will recognize Him even when others don't
- Don't give up during silent seasons - God has good plans

## Anna's Legacy

While Anna lived during spiritually dark times, her prayers and faithfulness contributed to bringing the greatest revival to Israel - the coming of the Messiah. Her life proves that:

- **There is power in prayer** even when it seems routine
- **Consistency matters** more than recognition
- **God doesn't forget the faithful** even in silent seasons

> _"She never left the temple but stayed there day and night, worshiping God with fasting and prayer."_ — **Luke 2:37**

The message concluded with an encouragement that when God seems silent in our lives, His promises remain unchanged. He has not forgotten us, and He is still watching over us. In His perfect timing, He will answer our prayers and fulfill His plans for our lives.

Even in the silence, we are not forgotten.
