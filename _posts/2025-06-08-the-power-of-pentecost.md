## The Foundation: Not By Might, But By My Spirit

The sermon opened with God's declaration from Zechariah 4:6:

> _"Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts."_

**Key Truth:** The church and believers cannot accomplish God's work without God's Spirit. Human effort and strength are insufficient for spiritual ministry and evangelism.

## Jesus' Final Instructions to His Disciples

From Luke 24:44-53, Pastor Sael highlighted Jesus' last words to His disciples before His ascension:

> _"And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me."_

**Important Point:** Jesus opened their understanding to comprehend the Scriptures, just as the Lord opens our understanding today to grasp His Word and our calling.

## The Promise of Power from On High

Jesus commanded His disciples:

> _"But tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high."_ — **Luke 24:49**

> _"But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."_ — **Acts 1:8**

**The Divine Requirement:** Before beginning ministry, the disciples needed the baptism of the Holy Spirit. This same requirement applies to believers today.

## The Dramatic Transformation at Pentecost

### Before Pentecost: Fear and Denial

- The disciples were hiding in fear
- Peter denied Jesus three times before a rooster crowed
- They lacked courage to speak openly about Christ
- They were scattered and confused

### After Pentecost: Boldness and Power

- They spoke openly to large crowds without fear
- They confronted civil and religious authorities boldly
- They declared: _"We cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard"_ (Acts 4:20)
- Nothing could stop them from preaching the Gospel

**The Catalyst:** The power of Pentecost completely transformed their character, courage, and effectiveness in ministry.

## The Historical Impact of Spirit-Filled Believers

Within just 20 years after Pentecost, the early Christians were labeled as _"these that have turned the world upside down"_ (Acts 17:6).

**Napoleon Bonaparte's Observation:** _"There are only two forces in the history of the world: the sword and the spirit. In the long run, the sword will always be conquered by the spirit."_

This demonstrates the incredible power and lasting impact of Spirit-filled believers throughout history.

## The Holy Spirit as Our Parakletos (Helper)

Pastor Sael explained the Greek term "parakletos" using the illustration of ancient Greek warriors:

**The Warrior Principle:** Greek soldiers went into battle in pairs to protect each other's blind spots. When one faced the enemy, his partner guarded his back.

**Spiritual Application:** The Holy Spirit serves as our divine partner in spiritual warfare, protecting us from attacks we cannot see and empowering us for victory.

## Spiritual Hunger in Today's World

**Global Evidence:** The fastest-growing parts of Christianity worldwide are Pentecostal movements, demonstrating the continued hunger for the authentic power of the Holy Spirit.

**Present Reality:** There is a deep spiritual hunger both in the world and within the church today. People are seeking genuine spiritual experience and transformation.

## Daily Transformation Through the Spirit

**Continuous Work:** The Holy Spirit can bring about daily transformation in believers' lives. Whether at work, school, home, or anywhere else, the Holy Ghost can move and create positive change.

**Constant Availability:** The power of Pentecost is not limited to church services but is available 24/7 for those who are filled with the Spirit.

## The Shift from Kingdom to Spirit Focus

When the disciples asked about restoring Israel's kingdom, Jesus redirected their attention:

> _"It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you..."_ — **Acts 1:7-8**

**Divine Priority:** Jesus shifted their focus from earthly kingdom restoration to receiving spiritual power for worldwide evangelism.

## Three Phases of God's Presence

### 1. Bethlehem - God WITH Us

> _"Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us."_ — **Matthew 1:23**

### 2. Calvary - God FOR Us

> _"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."_ — **Romans 5:8**

### 3. Pentecost - God IN Us

> _"Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you."_ — **John 14:17**

## The Baptism of the Holy Spirit: Not Optional

**Clear Command:** Jesus commanded ALL His disciples to wait for the promise of the Father. This was not presented as an option but as a necessity for effective ministry.

**Universal Need:** Just as the early church needed the baptism of the Holy Ghost before embarking on ministry, believers today also need this same empowerment.

**Available Gift:** The Holy Spirit baptism is a gift that can be received by faith. It's not earned through works but received through believing prayer and surrender.

## Evidence of True Pentecostal Power

**Genuine Transformation:** When someone truly receives the power of Pentecost, there will be noticeable change in their life, character, and spiritual effectiveness.

**Unstoppable Witness:** Like the early disciples, Spirit-filled believers cannot help but share what they have experienced and witnessed.

**Supernatural Boldness:** Fear is replaced by divine courage to witness, even in the face of opposition or persecution.

## The Call to Receive and Respond

Pastor Sael concluded with a powerful invitation for believers to:

### Prepare Your Hearts

Open your heart and mind to receive what God wants to give you today.

### Worship with Expectation

Approach God with all your heart and mind, expecting to receive the power of the Holy Spirit.

### Become Witnesses

Use every tool available - phones, laptops, internet connections - to share the Gospel and witness God's love to a dark world.

### Wait for Greater Revival

Believe that God can use modern technology and surrendered hearts for worldwide revival and transformation.

> _"Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts."_ — **Zechariah 4:6**

The power of Pentecost is real, available, and necessary for every believer today. It brings radical transformation, supernatural boldness, and effectiveness in ministry. The same Spirit that turned the world upside down through the early church is ready to work through surrendered believers in our generation. The question is not whether God has the power, but whether we will prepare our hearts to receive it.
