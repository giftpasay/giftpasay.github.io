### **FOREWORD**
The main theme of this book by **David Bernard (UPCI GS)** is how Apostolic Pentecostals should live and how the Apostolic Church should minister in a diverse, postmodern world.

---

## **FIRST SECTION: ‚ÄúDEVELOPING AN APOSTOLIC WORLDVIEW‚Äù**
*(Positions the Apostolic movement in contrast to other historical and modern Christian movements, identifying the core elements of an Apostolic worldview.)*

### **Topic: ANG MENSAHE AT KARANASAN NG MGA APOSTOL**  
**(The Message and Experience of the Apostles)**

Sa isang pabago-bagong kultura at panahon gaya ng postmodern world, napakahalaga na nauunawaan natin **kung ano ang ating pinaniniwalaan, at bakit natin ito pinaniniwalaan.**  
Ano ang bumubuo sa ating **identity bilang biblical Christians?** Ano ang ating **pundasyon**? At ano ang **hindi dapat magbago**?

What makes Apostolic Pentecostals distinct?  
The answer: more than any other group, we believe that **the teachings and practices of the apostles of Jesus Christ‚Äîas written in the New Testament‚Äîcarry supreme authority and serve as the perfect model for the modern church.**

---

## **Core Apostolic Beliefs**

Like many conservative Christian groups today, we teach several foundational truths:

1. **There is only one Creator** ‚Äî the one true God.  
2. **The Bible** is the inspired and infallible Word of God.  
3. **Jesus Christ** is both God and man‚Äîour Lord and Savior.  
4. The **Gospel** proclaims that Jesus died for our sins, was buried, rose again, and lives forever.  
5. **Salvation** comes through faith in Jesus Christ and His redemptive work.  
6. **Jesus will return** for His people.  
7. **All humanity** will stand before God in final judgment‚Äîreceiving eternal reward or eternal punishment.

However, unlike many other Christian groups, **Apostolic Pentecostals believe that the same message and experience of the New Testament Church should still be preached and experienced today.**

For example, when people believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and repent of their sins, they should expect to receive the **gift of the Holy Spirit** with the **miraculous sign of speaking in other tongues**, just as recorded in Acts 2:1‚Äì4 and Acts 11:15‚Äì17.

## **The Authority of the Apostles**

Are we mistaken to believe that our message and experience today mirror those of the early apostles?  
According to Jesus‚Äî**no.**

After choosing the twelve apostles, He said:

> *‚ÄúHe that receives you receives Me; and he that receives Me receives Him that sent Me.‚Äù*  
> ‚Äî Matthew 10:40

After the Last Supper, Jesus promised:

> *‚ÄúBut the Comforter, which is the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.‚Äù*  
> ‚Äî John 14:26

This divine teaching would empower them to pass on truth to others.  
Jesus also prayed not only for His apostles but for all future believers who would accept Him through their word:

> *‚ÄúNeither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word.‚Äù*  
> ‚Äî John 17:20

Here, Jesus included **us**‚Äîthe modern believers‚Äîunder the same faith and message delivered by the apostles.

He also gave them **authority to proclaim forgiveness and deliverance** through the Gospel and the plan of salvation (Matthew 18:18; John 20:23).  
After His resurrection, Jesus commissioned them to **preach the Gospel, baptize believers, and teach all His commandments** (Matthew 28:19‚Äì20).

---

## **Continuing the Apostolic Mission**

Jesus did not personally establish local congregations or write any books.  
Instead, He entrusted this mission to the **apostles and their co-laborers.**  
It was His plan that future converts would become disciples by accepting the authority of the apostles through **obedience to their message.**

As recorded in Acts 2:42:

> *‚ÄúAnd they continued steadfastly in the apostles‚Äô doctrine and fellowship, in breaking of bread, and in prayers.‚Äù*

The apostle Paul later affirmed that the Gospel he preached to the Gentiles was the same Gospel preached by the original apostles‚Äîidentical to Peter‚Äôs message to the Jews (Galatians 2:1‚Äì10).  
He emphasized that this Gospel is the **only true Gospel** to be received and believed (Galatians 1:8‚Äì9).  

Paul described the Church as being:

> *‚Äú‚Ä¶built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone.‚Äù*  
> ‚Äî Ephesians 2:20

Thus, the message, teaching, experience, and practice of the apostles are the **model for the Church today.**

God continues to use multiple witnesses to confirm His truth (2 Corinthians 13:1).  
While some New Testament practices were cultural or temporary, any **apostolic norm** established for **order, holiness, or God‚Äôs glory** should be continued.  
If something is missing from the modern church, it must be **restored**.  
If a practice violates apostolic teaching, it must be **rejected**.

## **Summary of Apostolic Identity (Acts 2 Pattern)**

The essential marks of Apostolic identity are summarized in Acts 2, where both message and experience unite as one:

### **Key Apostolic Identities**

1. **Repentance**  
   ‚Äì A vital experience of turning away from sin and turning toward God.  
   ‚Äì It is not merely a verbal confession of faith but a deep spiritual transformation.

2. **Water Baptism**  
   ‚Äì Part of Christian initiation, for the remission of sins.  
   ‚Äì Should be performed by **immersion in water in the name of Jesus Christ**.

3. **Spirit Baptism**  
   ‚Äì Also part of Christian initiation, distinct from confession, repentance, or water baptism.  
   ‚Äì Evidenced by **speaking in other tongues** as the Spirit gives utterance.

4. **Miracles, Healings, and Gifts of the Spirit**  
   ‚Äì Should accompany the preaching of the Word and remain active in the Church today.

5. **Holiness and Lifestyle**  
   ‚Äì Believers are called to a life of prayer, worship, and both **inward and outward holiness**.

6. **The Oneness of God in Christ**  
   ‚Äì Jesus is the one true God of the Old Testament (Jehovah) manifested in the flesh as the Savior of the world.  
   ‚Äì The idea of a second or coequal divine person is foreign to apostolic teaching; the apostles upheld the faith in one God.

## **Restoring the Apostolic Church**

Other groups may acknowledge the apostles‚Äô experiences but do not prioritize them in doctrine or practice.  
For them, the apostles‚Äô message is the **starting point** of theology;  
for Apostolic Pentecostals, it is the **final authority**‚Äîthe completed revelation of God‚Äôs plan.

Our goal is not to modernize or reinvent the message, but to **restore and continue** the **original message and experience** of the Apostolic Church today.
