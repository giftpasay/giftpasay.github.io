## Victory Is Our Identity

**"Victory is not just a result; it is the identity of every child of God."** We serve a God who has never lost a battle and never will. From Genesis to Revelation, the Scriptures reveal a victorious God—conquering chaos, defeating enemies, and establishing His purpose on earth through those who trust in Him.

**Since the beginning of time, everything that the devil tried, God made it fail!**

> *"When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him."* — **Isaiah 59:19**

> *"But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."* — **1 Corinthians 15:57**

**Be not afraid... Everything that the devil tries... God made it fail!**

## The God of Victory

**In the face of battles—spiritual, emotional, financial, or relational—believers must remember that our God is the God of Victory.** He not only gives victory but embodies it. He goes before His people, fights for them, and causes them to triumph gloriously.

**This divine victory is not earned through physical strength but through:**
- **Faith** in God's promises
- **Obedience** to His commands
- **Reliance** on His power

### Commanded to Be Fearless in Battle

> *"When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the Lord thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people, And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them; For the Lord your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you."* — **Deuteronomy 20:1-4**

**God's instruction is clear:** When you face overwhelming odds, **do not be afraid** because the Lord your God goes with you to fight for you.

### More Than Conquerors

> *"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."* — **Romans 8:37-39**

**We are not just conquerors—we are MORE than conquerors** through Him who loved us. Nothing can separate us from His love or His victory.

## I. Israel Avenged by God

**After 430 years, God Almighty brought Israel out of Egyptian bondage.** He brought 3-6 million Jews out of bondage in one night! Yes, He did it in one night. **All the years of praying, all the years of believing were wrapped in one great moment!**

> *"And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows."* — **Exodus 3:7**

> *"And the Lord spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me."* — **Exodus 8:1**

### God's Swift Power

**Consider what God can do:**
- **God can answer all your prayers in 30 seconds**
- **He can turn our church around in one weekend**
- **He can bring the backsliders back in one day**
- **He can save our friends and loved ones in an instant**
- **They are not lost forever; they will not go to hell**
- **We believe God has given us extraordinary power over the enemy**

**God made Pharaoh's resistance fail!**

## II. God Fights for His People in Times of Battle

**We are never alone in the battles of life.** God Himself enters the fight on our behalf.

### A. The Battle Is the Lord's

> *"And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the Lord unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's. Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them: for the Lord will be with you."* — **2 Chronicles 20:15-17**

**When we acknowledge our weakness, His strength takes over.** The battle belongs to the Lord, not to us.

### B. God Raises a Standard Against the Enemy

> *"So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him."* — **Isaiah 59:19**

**When the enemy comes like a flood, God sets a divine boundary.** The Spirit of the Lord raises a standard—a banner of protection and victory.

### C. God Surrounds His People with Angelic Protection

> *"The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them."* — **Psalm 34:7**

**We are covered even when we cannot see the warfare.** God's angelic hosts surround and protect His people.

### D. Our Weapons Are Spiritual, Not Carnal

> *"For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds."* — **2 Corinthians 10:4**

**Victory is secured through:**
- **Prayer** - communicating with our Commander
- **The Word** - wielding the sword of the Spirit
- **Worship** - declaring God's supremacy

> *"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord."* — **Romans 12:19**

**Leave vengeance to God—He will make the enemy's schemes fail!**

## III. The Devil Cast Out of Heaven

**When God had enough of the devil and his rebellion, He threw him out of heaven.**

> *"And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven."* — **Luke 10:18**

**He cast him out of heaven at about 186,000 miles per second.** It didn't take Him long to get rid of him.

### Our Authority Over the Enemy

> *"Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you."* — **Luke 10:19**

**Jesus has given us authority over all the power of the enemy.**

**The devil is a liar:**
- **If the devil could kill you, you would not be alive today** - he would have already done it
- **If the devil said he can tear our church up, it's a lie!**
- **This church is predestined for victory, glory, revival, and growth**

**God made Satan's rebellion fail!** (See Ezekiel 28:11-19)

## IV. A Great Mystery: The Rapture

> *"Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."* — **1 Corinthians 15:51-52**

**In a moment, God is going to raise every Apostolic saint who died in faith.**

**Death is not a demotion but a promotion** because the dead in Christ shall rise first. All your dead loved ones in Christ cannot be lesser—they're going to be first.

**Every tongue-talking, Holy Ghost-filled Apostolic believer** who lives for God and pleases God will be changed. The dead shall rise and all that are alive shall be caught up to meet the Lord in the air in a moment.

**It will not take God too long to get us out of here.**

**There will be a day when every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.** This is God's speedy vengeance. He will rectify, vindicate, reimburse, and pay back—and He will do it speedily!

## V. The Enemy's Biggest Mistake

> *"But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."* — **1 Corinthians 2:7-8**

**The enemy's biggest mistake was crucifying Jesus.** What looked like Satan's victory became God's ultimate triumph. **The cross that was meant to destroy became the instrument of our salvation!**

**God made the enemy's greatest scheme fail and turned it into our greatest victory!**

## VI. Divine Intervention = Supernatural Conquest

**Supernatural Conquest happens when God takes over the battle and produces victories that can only be attributed to Him.**

### 1. When God Takes Over the Battle

**Supernatural Conquest happens when God takes over the battle and fights for you.**

> *"Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you."* — **2 Chronicles 20:17-18**

**God took over the battle from Jehoshaphat** and gave complete victory.

### 2. When Victory Depends on God, Not Man

**Supernatural Conquest happens when the victory depends on God and not man.**

> *"Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied."* — **1 Samuel 17:45**

**David knew he was no match for Goliath physically,** but he trusted in God to defeat Goliath through him. (1 Samuel 17:45-47)

### 3. When the World Knows God Fought for You

**Supernatural Conquest has marks and characteristics that make the whole world know clearly that it was God who fought for you and gave the victory.**

**The Philistines testified about the Israelites** that their God defeated the Egyptians for them. (1 Samuel 4:8-9)

### 4. When Battles Are Won Effortlessly

**Supernatural Conquest happens when battles are won effortlessly, and when victories cannot be explained.**

**David was able to escape all assassination attempts against him by King Saul.** (1 Samuel 18:11-12) God's protection was supernatural and unexplainable.

### 5. When Wickedness Becomes Blessing

**Supernatural Conquest happens when God turns around the wickedness done against you for your blessings.**

**Every act of wickedness against Joseph was a divine step to the fulfillment of his dreams.** (Genesis 45:3-8)

> *"But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive."* — **Genesis 50:20**

### 6. When Enemies Fall Into Their Own Traps

**Supernatural Conquest happens when God makes your enemy fall in the pit they dug for you.**

**Haman was hanged on the gallows he made for Mordecai.** (Esther 7:9-10) The trap meant for God's people destroyed the enemy instead.

### 7. When God Suspends Natural Laws

**Supernatural Conquest happens when God suspends laws, protocols, and traditions to attend to your case.**

**Esther appeared before the king uninvited,** and rather than being killed (as the law required), she was greatly honored. (Esther 5:1-3)

**God made the law that threatened her fail!**

## Divine Interventions Today

**Now that we know what to look for, we're challenged to actually look.** The more you look, the more you'll see. And the more you see, the more you'll know God loves you.

### Understanding the Standard

**Old Testament Setting:**
> *"When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him."* — **Isaiah 59:19**

**New Testament Understanding:**
*"When the enemy shall come in, like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him."*

**The difference in punctuation changes everything!** The enemy may come in like a flood, but the Spirit of the Lord—like an even greater flood—lifts up a standard against him.

## Declaration of Victory

### God Is Our Refuge and Strength

> *"God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea... Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge."* — **Psalm 46:1-2, 10-11**

### From Envy to Understanding

> *"Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart. But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked... When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end."* — **Psalm 73:1-3, 16-17**

**When we enter God's presence, we gain His perspective** and understand that the enemy's apparent victories are temporary.
