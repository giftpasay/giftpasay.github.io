The Holy Spirit is not an impersonal force or a separate divine person, but **the Spirit of Jesus Christ living and working within us**. For Oneness Pentecostals, the Holy Spirit plays a central role in every aspect of salvation, sanctification, and daily Christian living. It is the indwelling power of God that transforms the heart, empowers the believer, and sustains the walk of faith.

## The Promise of the Spirit

The outpouring of the Holy Spirit was not a temporary event—it was the fulfillment of prophecy and the promise of Jesus Himself. In **Acts 1:8**, Jesus said:

> “But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me…”

The Holy Spirit is **God's empowering presence** in the believer’s life. In **John 14:17–18**, Jesus promised:

> “...he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.”

This promise was fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost when the Spirit was poured out in **Acts 2**, and continues to be fulfilled in every believer today.

## The Holy Spirit in the New Birth

According to **John 3:5**, Jesus said:

> “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”

This clearly teaches that being born of the Spirit is essential for salvation. In Acts 2:38, Peter outlined the full plan of salvation: **repentance, baptism in Jesus’ name, and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost**.

The initial evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit is **speaking in other tongues**, as shown in:

- **Acts 2:4** – _“...and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.”_
- **Acts 10:44–46** – _“...for they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God.”_
- **Acts 19:6** – _“...they spake with tongues, and prophesied.”_

This supernatural sign confirms the indwelling presence of God.

## The Spirit as Teacher and Comforter

Once the Holy Ghost fills a believer, His role does not stop at salvation. The Spirit **teaches, leads, convicts, comforts, and empowers**:

- **John 14:26** – _“The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost... shall teach you all things...”_
- **Romans 8:14** – _“For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.”_
- **John 16:13** – _“Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth...”_

The Holy Spirit becomes a daily helper, guiding us into holiness and helping us to live out the will of God.

## Power to Overcome and Bear Fruit

The Holy Spirit gives us **power over sin** and enables us to **bear spiritual fruit**. Without the Spirit, it is impossible to please God or live a victorious life.

- **Romans 8:9** – _“Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.”_
- **Galatians 5:22–23** – _“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering…”_

The Spirit not only frees us from bondage to sin, but also transforms our character to reflect Jesus.

## Gifts of the Spirit

The Holy Spirit also equips believers with **spiritual gifts** for the edification of the Church:

- **1 Corinthians 12** lists gifts such as wisdom, healing, faith, prophecy, and tongues.
- These gifts are not for self-glorification, but for **serving and strengthening the Body of Christ**.
- The same Spirit that saves us also empowers us to **minister effectively** to others.

## Conclusion

The Holy Spirit is not a side note in the Christian life—it is **the very life of Christ within us**. From the moment of new birth to our daily walk, He empowers, sanctifies, leads, and comforts us. To be filled with the Holy Ghost is to be filled with **the power, presence, and purpose of God**.

Let us not settle for a powerless Christianity. Let us be filled, led,
