## The Central Question

With global tensions escalating and Israel dominating world headlines, Christians worldwide are asking: Are we living in the end times? While scholars debate the sequence of prophetic events, there's widespread agreement that Israel will play an increasingly vital role as ancient prophecies unfold.

Our Pastor addressed the fundamental question: **What is Israel's role in the end times according to Scripture?**

The answer is both simple and profound: **The same role Israel has always had - to be God's witness to the nations.**

## Israel's Eternal Calling as Witness

God sovereignly chose Abraham and his descendants for a divine purpose - to make Him known to the world. This calling has never been rescinded. As Isaiah declared:

> _"But now listen, O Jacob, My servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen... And you are My witnesses, Is there any God besides Me, Or is there any other Rock? I know of none."_ — **Isaiah 44:1, 8**

**Historical perspective:** In the 18th century, when atheist King Frederick the Great of Prussia demanded proof of God's existence, one advisor responded he could prove it in two words: "the Jews."

## The Nature of Israel's Witness

Israel doesn't merely have a message - **Israel IS the message**. The nation serves as living proof of God's existence, faithfulness, and sovereignty.

**Important clarification:** While Gentile believers have been grafted into this covenant calling as witnesses, the Church's inclusion doesn't require Israel's exclusion. God's covenant with Israel remains eternal and unconditional, established with creation itself as the sign.

> _"Thus says the Lord, Who gives the sun for light by day and the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night... 'If this fixed order departs from before Me,' declares the Lord, 'Then the offspring of Israel also will cease from being a nation before Me forever.'"_ — **Jeremiah 31:35-36**

## Five Ways Israel Witnesses in the End Times

### 1. Israel's Rebirth as a Nation

Jesus prophesied that His return wouldn't occur until Jewish leadership in Jerusalem welcomed Him back with _"Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!"_ (Matthew 23:37-39).

**The prophetic fulfillment:** From AD 70 until May 14, 1948, there was no Jewish authority in Jerusalem. Then, in the aftermath of the Holocaust and World War II, Israel was literally reborn as a nation in a single day - exactly as Isaiah prophesied.

**Key milestones:**

- 1948: Israel's independence declared
- 1967: Jerusalem reunified under Jewish control
- 76 years of continuous witness to God's faithfulness

This miraculous survival, return, and national rebirth serves as profound testimony that God keeps His promises and prepares the world stage for His Son's return.

### 2. Israel's Military Victories

Despite overwhelming odds, God has preserved and protected Israel through numerous conflicts:

- **1948 War of Independence** - 650,000 Jews against millions in the Arab world
- **1967 Six-Day War** - Victory against multiple powerful armies
- **1973 Yom Kippur War** - Supernatural preservation
- **Current conflicts** - Ongoing protection against Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran

**The prophetic war:** Ezekiel 38-39 describes the future war of Gog and Magog, where God will supernaturally defend Israel against a northern coalition. The result will be unmistakable witness:

> _"It shall come about in the last days that I will bring you against My land, so that the nations may know Me when I am sanctified through you before their eyes, O Gog."_ — **Ezekiel 38:16**

### 3. Israel's Message During Jacob's Trouble

The seven-year Tribulation period will feature unprecedented global upheaval, yet Jesus declared:

> _"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come."_ — **Matthew 24:14**

**The 144,000 witnesses:** Revelation 7 introduces Jewish believers who will spread the gospel during this time. Whether literal or symbolic, they represent a complete number from within Israel chosen for end-time evangelism.

**Dual reality:** The Tribulation will bring both devastating judgment and the greatest harvest of souls in history. Israel will play a central role in this final witness to the nations.

### 4. Israel's Supernatural Protection

Revelation 12 portrays Israel as "a woman" whom Satan will persecute in the end times. However, God will supernaturally protect and nourish her for 3½ years.

**The witness factor:** Israel's miraculous preservation will testify to Satan himself that he cannot override God's will and purpose. Even the enemy will be forced to acknowledge God's sovereignty through Israel's protection.

### 5. Israel's Restoration to the Lord

The ultimate witness comes when Christ returns and all remaining Israel recognizes Jesus as their Messiah:

> _"And I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son."_ — **Zechariah 12:10**

**The prophetic promise:**

> _"And so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, 'The Deliverer will come from Zion, He will remove ungodliness from Jacob.'"_ — **Romans 11:26**

## The Bride and Bridegroom

In the millennial kingdom, Jesus will reign from Jerusalem with Israel as the chief of nations. Isaiah describes a "chuppah" (bridal canopy) over Mount Zion, symbolizing God's restored relationship with His covenant people.

**The global impact:** Nations will seek the Lord in Jerusalem, with ten men from every nation grasping the garment of a Jew, saying, _"Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you"_ (Zechariah 8:23).

## Our Role as Witnesses Today

Just as Israel serves as God's witness, believers today are called to maintain their testimony in these last days. Jesus's parable of the ten virgins warns us to stay ready:

**The wise virgins:**

- Kept their wicks trimmed
- Maintained a full supply of oil (Holy Spirit)
- Were ready when the bridegroom returned

**Our calling:**

- Remain watchful for Christ's return
- Keep our testimony flowing
- Pray for Israel's spiritual awakening
- Take our stand as witnesses

## Modern Confirmation: Netanyahu's Testament

Our Pastor included Prime Minister Netanyahu's powerful speech highlighting Israel's miraculous survival and prosperity:

**From persecution to prominence:**

- 70 years ago: Jews led to slaughter like sheep
- 60 years ago: No country, no army, facing seven Arab nations
- Today: Advanced military, thriving economy, space program, medical breakthroughs

**Historical perspective:** Every empire that tried to destroy Israel has vanished, while Israel remains. Hebrew, the language of the Bible, is still spoken today in the restored nation.

**Netanyahu's declaration:** _"The Guardian of Israel never slumbers or sleeps! The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob created the heavens and the earth."_

## The Final Reality

**In conclusion:** The original design will be the final display! Israel's role as witness began with Abraham and will culminate in the millennial kingdom when all nations flow to Jerusalem to seek the Lord.

> _"How lovely on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who announces peace and brings good news of happiness, who announces salvation, and says to Zion, 'Your God reigns!'"_ — **Isaiah 52:7**

The study revealed that understanding Israel's role in the end times isn't merely academic - it's deeply personal. As believers grafted into this covenant calling, we too are witnesses in these pivotal days. The question remains: Will we take our stand and maintain our testimony until He comes?
