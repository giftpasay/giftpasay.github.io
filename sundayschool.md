## The Dangerous Question About Grace

Min. Mike opened this Romans 6 study by addressing a dangerous misconception that arises from understanding grace. Following Paul's teaching in Romans 5 about grace abounding where sin increased, some might ask:

> _"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?"_ — **Romans 6:1**

Since we understand that we're saved by grace through faith and not by works, does this mean we can live carelessly in sin, knowing God will continuously forgive us?

Paul's response was emphatic: **"God forbid!"** This represents a strong disagreement - it should absolutely not be this way.

## The Foundation: Dead to Sin Through Baptism

The apostle Paul builds his argument on a fundamental truth about what happens when someone becomes a Christian:

### Water Baptism - Our Death and Burial

> _"Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death."_ — **Romans 6:3-4**

Min. Mike emphasized several crucial points about baptism:

- **We are baptized INTO Christ** - not into a religion, denomination, or because of a pastor
- **Baptism symbolizes death and burial** - this is why full immersion is necessary
- **We partake in Christ's death** through water baptism
- **Complete burial is required** - just as no one buries a dead person with parts still showing, baptism must be full immersion

### The New Life Reality

> _"That like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."_ — **Romans 6:4**

After being buried with Christ in baptism, believers are raised to walk in **newness of life**. This means:

- **Old things have passed away** - the things we used to do, places we used to go, and ways we used to live
- **We are new creatures** in Christ Jesus
- **We have been cleansed and justified** through Jesus

## The Old Man Must Be Crucified

Min. Mike addressed a critical aspect of Christian living:

> _"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin."_ — **Romans 6:6**

### Understanding the Old Man

**Important distinction:** The Bible doesn't say the old man is already dead - it says he must be **crucified**. This means:

- **Even as Christians**, our old nature still exists within us
- **We must daily crucify** the old man with Christ
- **This is an ongoing battle** - we face this struggle every day
- **The old man waits** for opportunities to take charge and control

### The Purpose of Crucifying the Old Man

When we crucify our old nature with Christ:

- **The body of sin is destroyed**
- **We are freed from serving sin**
- **Sin loses its dominion over us**

## Sin No Longer Has Dominion

> _"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace."_ — **Romans 6:14**

Min. Mike made a powerful point about spiritual authority:

### Christ Has Already Overcome

> _"Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him."_ — **Romans 6:9**

Just as death has no power over the resurrected Christ, **sin has no dominion over believers**. Yet many Christians still experience spiritual weakness. Why?

### The Real Issue: Personal Decision

Min. Mike explained that when Christians experience spiritual weakness or defeat:

- **It's not death/sin having dominion** - Christ already overcame that
- **It's the believer choosing** to give control to their old nature
- **We must decide** to give God our best worship and service
- **There's no one else to blame** when we grow weak spiritually

## Living as New Creatures

> _"Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord."_ — **Romans 6:11**

### What This Means Practically

**Dead to sin but alive to God:**

- **Don't let sin reign** in your mortal body
- **Don't yield your body parts** as instruments of unrighteousness
- **Yield yourselves to God** as those alive from the dead
- **Use your body parts** as instruments of righteousness

### Our Purpose and Calling

Min. Mike reminded the congregation:

- **We are blessed** to understand our purpose while many are still searching
- **We know why we're here** - to give God all the glory
- **Every part of our body** should be used to please Jesus Christ
- **We must be thankful** that we're still in the race while others have given up

## The Warning Against Misusing Grace

The lesson concluded with a strong warning against **"Holy Ghost tourism"** - the practice of coming to church but living carnally the rest of the week.

### Grace Doesn't Mean License to Sin

- **Grace empowers us** to live free from sin's dominion
- **We are no longer under law** but under grace
- **This freedom** should motivate holy living, not careless living
- **Many believers** are slowly being overtaken by the world and sin

### The Ongoing Battle

Min. Mike acknowledged that even committed Christians face daily struggles:

- **Sometimes our old man tries to awaken** and take control
- **We must be vigilant** and continue the daily battle
- **Prayer is needed** for those who have given up the race
- **We must remain thankful** and committed to our calling

## Looking Ahead

This lesson covered the first part of Romans 6, focusing on the sin that dwells within believers even after conversion. Min. Mike announced that next Sunday's lesson will cover the second part of Romans 6, which addresses **occasional sins** that Christians may fall into.

---

> _"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?"_ — **Romans 6:1-2**

The message was clear: Understanding grace properly leads to freedom FROM sin, not freedom TO sin. Christians must daily choose to crucify their old nature and walk in the newness of life that Christ has provided through His death, burial, and resurrection.
